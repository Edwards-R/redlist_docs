# Bombus ruderarius: iso. Cameron et al: 2007
## Provisional status: VU
- A2 b,c

## Justification
There is a notable lack of data in last 5 year period which cannot be adequately explained. There is always a risk of singular recorders not providing data, stopping recording etc, leading to shortfalls in data. However, a bumblebee experiencing a ~50% decline over a 10 year period is highly unusual. Systematic recording changes could explain this, but there are other warning signs. Two recent books (Bees of Sussex & Bees of Norfolk) note a significant decline in sightings. One potential reason is the loss of edge habitat, but this has not at all been confirmed. Contributing to difficulties is that the taxon is difficult to positively identify.

## Criterion A2 (Expert Inference)
|Attribute|Assessment|Value|Accepted|Justification
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Internal review|VU|Identification confusion observed in dataset, suspected to have inflated values. Notable potential confusion in identification by inexperienced recorders. Bees of Sussex & Bees of Norfolk note a significant decline. Potential reason is the loss of edge habitat. Bumblebees in general are not typically low data volume taxa, so the lack of records between 2017 and 2021 is highly unusual.|Yes||
