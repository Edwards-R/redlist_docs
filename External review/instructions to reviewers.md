# Instructions to reviewers
Thank you for agreeing to review the GB Aculeate Hymenoptera Red List. The goal of this stage, which we are calling the External Review, is to gather feedback on the proposed Red List statuses, especially those in threatened categories. 

There is no specific requirement for taxa to be reviewed - we are relying on your experience to identify taxa which you believe to be likely to require review. Work within your budget, and please do reach out to Rowan if you want more details on a particular taxon.

### A note on the Red List Guidance
We have been instructed by Natural England to follow the 'Red List Guidance' very strictly. This has proven a very difficult task to do, as the Red List Guidance makes a number of entirely nonsensical or inappropriate assumptions as to the state of knowledge available.
 
The only nod in the Guidance to Aculeate hymenoptera assumes that we know:
- the average number of nests/sq km of a taxon
- the ratio of workers:reproductives
- the number of reproductives/nest

Then all we need is a working, documented, and tested model that incorporates all the above, as well as a full understanding of how this will affect the probability of the taxon going extinct over various time periods. Needless to say, this is an utterly ridiculous expectation that is simply not met.

The practical result is that there may be taxa in this assessment where you believe that the proposed status is entirely inappropriate. It may well be that the assessors believe the same, yet are unable to find a justification for increasing the threat status of a taxon under the Red List criteria. The past 10 years have seen an overall growth in many of the subject taxa due to climate effects, which may be obscuring longer-term declines. In such situations, we have attempted to at least come up with *something* to flag such species, but we have encountered significant difficulties in some situations.

If you believe that a taxon's proposed status is incorrect, please do follow the instructions below to propose an amendment. However, the process is still strictly controlled by the Red List Guidance, which limits what we can and cannot do. It may be that we are unable to implement a given suggestion to the eventual Red List. Please do not take this as a judgement of your opinion - we will be doing everything we can to include as much of your feedback as possible. Even if we cannot incorporate specific comments to the final result, we will at least be including them as supplemental data for others to examine so that your work is not lost.

## Instructions
> The Red List is an assessment of *threat*, rather than *rarity*. A very rare taxon may be `Least Concern` in many ways. For example, *Lasioglossum laticeps: iso. Amiet et al: 2001*, which is simply on the northern edge of its range and expanding.

When reviewing, each taxon status may be modified in one of three ways. The first, and simplest, manner is using the Red List moderation process. A taxon may be modified up or down, by one step, by a reviewer. The steps are, in order of lowest threat to highest:

- LC
- NT
- VU
- EN
- CR

If you wish to moderate a taxon, you will need to provide a justification for this moderation. This justification will be checked by the Red List Internal Review team, plus Richard Smith from Natural England, to ensure that it meets the Red List Guidance. Common sense and good science are not entirely enshrined within the Red List criteria, though the Internal Review team is doing its best to include them.

The second manner is by utilising Criterion A2: Expert Opinion. This question is **strictly** limited to changes in the years 2012 - 2021, and must encompass change over the entire GB range of the taxon. The question that must be answered for an adjustment under A2 is:

> According to your best knowledge, has the taxon declined, over its entire GB range, by:
> 
>    - \>=80% \>\> CR
>    - \>=50% \>\> EN
>    - \>=30% \>\> VU
>
> between 2012 and 2021 (inclusive)
> 
> If you suspect the taxon has declined, over its entire range, but not to the point of 30%, then the taxon may be given NT or 'Near Threatened'

You will, again, need to provide justification for your statement for the Red List to be able to utilise your assessment.

Thirdly, if you truly believe that a taxon's status is not correct *and* you cannot work the change under the previous two rules, contact Rowan and he will try to find time for a discussion. Please note that the time and budget for this step is very limited.
