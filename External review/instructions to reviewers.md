# Instructions to reviewers

- Selected for your taxon-specific knowledge
- You have a set budget
- Pick the taxa you feel that you have the best knowledge on or want to look at
- If you want to see raw numbers and statistical models, talk to Rowan.
  - Models need appreciation of their limits

- Red Lists are an assessment of *threat*, not of rarity
- Something can be very rare, yet not under threat

- The project has been instructed to follow the Red List instructions *very* strictly
  - You may moderate the status up, or down, by *one* step
  - Any moderation *must* be supported by evidence
  - We're going to bend the rules and say that expert's opinion constitutes evidence

- If you disagree with a status, there are two methods of providing a correction
- The simplest is to moderate the result up or down one step
- The steps are, from lowest threat status to most:
  - LC
  - NT
  - VU
  - EN
  - CR


- If you want to moderate an answer by more than one step, the simplest method is via criterion A2
  - According to your best knowledge, has the taxon declined, over its entire range, by:
    - \>=80% \>\> CR
    - \>=50% \>\> EN
    - \>=30% \>\> VU
  - If you suspect the taxon has declined, over its entire range, but not to the point of 30%, then the taxon may be given NT or 'Near Threatened'

- If you want to moderate a taxon by more than one step, but cannot fit that moderation into A2, talk to Rowan.
- It may be that we cannot work your reasoning into the Red List criteria
  - This has happened to the Internal Review team a few times already

Thank you for agreeing to review the GB Aculeate Hymenoptera Red List. The goal of this stage, which we are calling the External Review, is to gather feedback on the proposed Red List statuses, especially those in threatened categories. 

There is no specific requirement for taxa to be reviewed - we are relying on your experience to identify taxa which you believe to be likely to require review. Work within your budget, and please do reach out to Rowan if you want more details on a particular taxon.

## Instructions
> The Red List is an assessment of *threat*, rather than *rarity*. A very rare taxon may be `Least Concern` in many ways. For example, *Lasioglossum laticeps: iso. Amiet et al: 2001*, which is simply on the northern edge of its range and expanding.

When reviewing, each taxon status may be modified in one of three ways. The first, and simplest, manner is using the Red List moderation process. A taxon may be modified up or down, by one step, by a reviewer. The steps are, in order of lowest threat to highest:

- LC
- NT
- VU
- EN
- CR

If you wish to moderate a taxon, you will need to provide a justification for this moderation. This justification will be checked by the Red List Internal Review team, plus Richard Smith from Natural England, to ensure that it meets the Red List criteria. Common sense and good science are not entirely enshrined within the Red List criteria, though the Internal Review team is doing its best to include them.

The second manner is by utilising Criterion A2: Expert Opinion. This question is **strictly** limited to changes in the years 2012 - 2021, and must encompass change over the entire GB range of the taxon. The question that must be answered for an adjustment under A2 is:

> According to your best knowledge, has the taxon declined, over its entire GB range, by:
> 
>    - \>=80% \>\> CR
>    - \>=50% \>\> EN
>    - \>=30% \>\> VU
>
> between 2012 and 2021 (inclusive)
> 
> If you suspect the taxon has declined, over its entire range, but not to the point of 30%, then the taxon may be given NT or 'Near Threatened'

You will, again, need to provide justification for your statement for the Red List to be able to utilise your assessment.

Thirdly, if you truly believe that a taxon's status is not correct *and* you cannot work the change under the previous two rules, contact Rowan and he will find time for a discussion.
