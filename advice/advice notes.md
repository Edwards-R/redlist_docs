## Get a statistician on the steering group
This is causing some significant problems with the use of statistical models. We're doing our best to follow the guidance of the statisticians who developed these models and their interpretations, but bringing people along is not easy to do. Having a statistician who is not involved in the development of the models being used to act as an unbiased touchstone for the steering group would relieve a lot of pressure.
