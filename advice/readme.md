# Readme
This section is primarily for use by the assessors. It contains notes, work-in-progress documentation, and will not conform to the strict formatting requirements of the main body of work.

## Initial run
Test out stuff first. Try to find out the general trends by looking at the most common taxa in bees/wasps/ants to get an idea of relative trends

## *How many* screens?!
This assessment method is designed for highly data-intensive scenarios. The volume of data and complexity of analysis means that a *lot* of documentation needs to be available. This is how we set ours out:

One screen displays the map
 - *This screen doubles up for QGIS if needed*
One screen displays the raw data
One screen displays the assessment results
One screen displays the documentation
Printed copy of the 'red list criteria' sheet

## Markdown format
The use of `markdown` format files has proven ***invaluable*** in creating a wiki-like environment for documentation. Glossary terms, cross-file linking, tables etc, all amazingly useful in communicating designs

## Flow charts
These are a great way to give a process to a third party to review or use. These were made with draw.io using the VSCode drawio plugin

## Software design tools
Pretty much everything in these docs is created for a software architecture background. It's not *traditional* and the output probably won't be a Word file, but at least this format is understandable *and* searchable. Let's be real - most people are just going to want a list of names and their status. However, *if* anyone wants to get into more detail then they have a clean step-by-step process to do so.

## 'Simple' summary of justification
I've tried. So hard. I can't condense the justification down to a single field because it simply isn't possible. Ever step builds upon the previous and can have some *very* complex interactions between different components. Attempting to cut all of this down to a single field would lose all nuance required to actually understand why a result has been given.
