## Checklists
It's not possible to use 'global' checklists as they simply don't exist at a quality level considered approproate by experts

The use of 'understandings' is denoted by pg 21 as an understanding is the appending of the work which directly informs the interpretation of that name

This is specifically asked for when not using a 'global' checklist:
>`For other taxonomic groups or any deviations from the recommended lists, the differences and the taxonomic authorities followed should be specified`
	
## Data and inference
### pg 6
>`when little or no observed data are available, assessors are encouraged make use of estimation, inference, projection and suspicion (IUCN 2001,2012)`

## Not Applicable
### pg 8
>`A taxon may be NA because it is not a wild population or not within its natural range in the region, or because it is a vagrant to the region.`

## Regional Extinction
### pg 8
>`The setting of any time limit for listing under RE is left to the discretion of the regional Red List authority`

## Wild population (re Apis)
### pg 9
>`A population within its natural range in which the individuals are the result of natural reproduction (i.e. not the result of human-mediated release or translocation)`

Apis is therefore not considered wild and should be excluded

## Vagrant populations
### pg 11
> `Vagrant taxa should NOT be assessed`

### pg 13
>`Taxa not eligible for assessment at the regional level (mainly introduced taxa and vagrants) should be assigned the category Not Applicable (NA).`

## Taking European populations into account
### pg 14
>`the existence and status of any conspecific populations outside the region that may affect the risk of extinction within the region should be investigated`

## Global Red List
There is no global redlist as per [checklists](#checklists). The closest is the European Red List, but that has numerous ommissions due to lack of data and nomenclatural cohesion.

The idea of a 'global Red List' in constantly referred to in the document, but there simply isn't a supportable document for these taxa.
