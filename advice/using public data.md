# On the use of 'general public' data

> *Question is 'why have you not used every piece of available data'?*

> What even *is* 'public data'? What makes it different BWARS data?

> A: Because we know that *some* of it is outright wrong. Accurate, species-level identification of aculeate hymenoptera is a skill that requires mastering over many years. We are also aware of errors appearing in public-facing recording systems, such as the NBN and iRecord, which do not have an identified or agreed-upon cause.

> A dataset ***very quickly*** takes on the quality of the *lowest common denominator*. It is not that we do not trust *all* 'public' data, but that there is a sufficient error rate to obscure 'reality'

> Q: How do we know this?

> A: A couple of big projects really informed this. The first is the Friends of the Earth's *Great British Bee Count*, where the general were asked to 'record bees'. The resulting data was place on the NBN, where it was subjected to criticism from a number of rather irate taxon experts on the basis that the proposed distribution of taxa was utterly unbelievable. This led to a number of changes, one of which was a push for 'data quality' indicators on the NBN, and one of which was for Friends of the Earth to run another count with taxonomic oversight. This second count came to the general conclusion that attempting to quality control vast amounts of data from well-meaning members of the public was

> Q: Why does this obscuration matter?
>
> A: Because we're looking at *threats* which are defined at an already frequently-inapplicable resolution. A very small amount of erroneous data carries the possibility of an extremely large change to the threat status of a taxon.

> Q: Is this a new problem?
>
> A: Not *really*, no. It's a fairly newly *recognised* problem, but quite honestly a big part of BWARS's ability to *see* this problem is because of a particular combination of a very capable data admin and a very interested, and experienced, system architect. There are *so many* problems surrounding biological recording that it has taken BWARS many years of work to get to the point where we can be *reasonably* confident that we do not hold vast amounts of poor quality data. There are still invalid records within the dataset and we still continue to remove or adjust invalid data that we find, but the volume is much lower than a wide swathe of 'general public' data.

## 'Citizen Science' myths

*Get rid of the idea of citizen science, the key point is confidence in data not a person's place of employment*

The phrase 'citizen science' is often touted as some magical watchword that will solve all problems. In my experience, this process is far more similar to watching a circus performer try to convince children that a horse with a horn stuck on its head is a unicorn.

The major divider between scientific and non-scientific data collection is not the employment of a particular person in a particular laboratory, but the degree of rigour to which the observer holds themselves.
