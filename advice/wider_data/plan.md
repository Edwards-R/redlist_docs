# Plan for using wider data
This is a **draft** plan for *a* way to integrate wider data into the Red List process in a *reasonably* cost-effective way, without destroying data quality.

Look at proportion of records to species/sub sp
Separate records based on correct 
Examine various trends:
- Common for background
  - Osmia bicornis
  - Bombus pascuorum
- Can ignore ants, Mike Fox has included these?
- North/south divide
- Ask Mike Fox how he looked at ant data
- Maintain separation of iRecord and BWARS datasets
- Separate BWARS into higher taxa - avoid the nomenclatural confusion
- Separate iRecord into higher taxa
- BWARS data call

Perspective is 'There are 300,000 records in iRecord and BWARS isn't using any of them'

## Need to investigate 

a) Are there 300,000 unique to-species records in iRecord, using the BWARS scientific standard data de-duplication routine

b) What does 'reliable' mean in the iRecord dataset

c) How reliable is the iRecord dataset

d) What is the spread of reliability in the iRecord dataset

e) How many unique, reliable records are there in the iRecord dataset

f) How many of the unique, reliable records in iRecord are present in the BWARS dataset

g) How many unique, reliable records in iRecord are considered wrong by BWARS

h) What is the general accuracy of verification, in iRecord, of the iRecord verifiers with a high capability for physical specimen identification
