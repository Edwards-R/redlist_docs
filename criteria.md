# Criteria
This document states which criteria may be considered for use in [model assessments](./glossary.md#model-assessment).

## Major Criterion Applicability

| Major Criterion | Used | Reason for rejection |
| --- | --- |--- |
| A | Yes | |
| B | Yes | |
| C | No | This criterion is unusable as it requires the population to be `estimated to number less than 2,500 mature individuals`. No metric available measures the number of mature individuals, and the number of 'mature individuals' at sampleable resolution is vastly inapplicable to the taxon group as a measure of threat. |
| D | No | D1 is Inapplicable for the same reasons as `C`. D2's absolute figures are not at a scale which makes sense for the majority of the assessed taxa, especially not in combination with the requirement for a **known** threat which may reduce the taxon to CR or EX in a short period. Any threats to taxa with a very small area are better captured under either `A` or `B` rather than attempting to extend the definition of D to fit the need.
| E | No | No models assess the potential of extinction at a given time point, as is required for this model. |


# Criterion A

## Major Criteria

| Criterion | Used | Reason for rejection |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | No | Inapplicable due to a requirement to understand the reason for a reduction. Reasons can be *suspected*, but in according with the ruling on [suspicion](./rulings.md#suspected), this is not sufficient to reach a threat status: `G5: If any of the three conditions (reversible and understood and ceased) are not met in a substantial portion of the taxon's population (10% or more), then A2 should be used instead of A1` |
| A2 | Yes | |
| A3 | Yes | |
| A4 | No | No model meets the required criteria for application: `G 5.3 In order to decide whether a taxon can be listed under criterion A4, a “moving-window” reduction must be calculated` |

## Minor Criteria
Extent of occurrence is to be interpreted as [discrete extent of occurrence](./rulings.md#discrete-extent-of-occurence)

| Criterion | Used | Reason for rejection |
|---|---|---|
| a) Direct Observation | No | Requires accurate census data: `G 5.1 (all counted - census)` |
| b) Index of abundance appropriate to the taxon | Yes | |
| c) Area, extent and/or quality of habitat | Yes | |
| d) Actual or potential levels of exploitation | No | Inapplicable to the taxa, they are not exploited for any resource. |
| e) The effects of introduced taxa, hybridization, pathogens, pollutants, competitors, or parasites | No | No known wide research performed on any of these metrics has been performed to a standard where it can be applied directly. Some taxa may have effects suspected, but no sufficient quality evidence is available to confirm yet. |


# Criterion B
Guidance on the use of **B** is very scarce. This is made harder by the fact that documentation refers to two different variations of EoO without discriminating between them (see [ruling](./rulings.md#extent-of-occurrence-eoo))

## Major Criteria

| Criterion | Used | Reason for rejection |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | No | This version of B1 **must** use cEoO, *not* dEoO. See [the ruling on B1](./rulings.md#continuous-extent-of-occurrence--b1) for more details |
| B2 | Yes | |

## Minor criteria

| Criterion | Used | Reason for rejection |
|---|---|---|
| a) Severely fragmented OR number of locations | Yes | |
| b) Continuing decline | Yes |  |
| c) Extreme fluctuation | No | No taxa have any evidence of extreme fluctuations with `G 4.7 a variation greater than one order of magnitude` |

## Subcriteria for b)
Extent of occurrence is to be interpreted as [discrete extent of occurrence](./rulings.md#discrete-extent-of-occurence)

| Criterion | Used | Reason for rejection |
|---|---|---|
| i) Extent of occurrence | Yes | |
| ii) Area of occupancy | Yes | |
| iii) Area, extent and/or quality of habitat | Yes | |
| iv) Number of locations | Yes | Locations are defined by threat as per [ruling](./rulings.md#threat-defined-locations) |
| v) Number of mature individuals| No | No data exists for number of mature individuals that matches the Red List standards. |

# Summary
These are the assessment criteria which may be used. Note that `B` requires *both* [minor criteria](#minor-criteria-1) to be met and at *least* one [subcriterion](#subcriteria-for-b) before it can be assigned.

| Major | Minor | Sub |
|---|---|---
| A2 | b, c | |
| A3 | b, c | |
| B2 | a, b | i), ii), iii) |
