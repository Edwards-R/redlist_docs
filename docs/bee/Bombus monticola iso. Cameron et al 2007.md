# Bombus monticola: iso. Cameron et al: 2007

## Provisional Red List status: NT
- A3 b
c

## Red List Justification
Restricted to highlands (~ >400m height). Climate change is anticipated to have a negative effect on significant amounts of habitat, with no opportunity for recovery elsewhere
### Narrative
Always a restricted bee, almost entirely restricted to north of the Severn-Wash line (with records for Dartmoor in the southwest only) the species has undergone significant population decrease in certain core areas including the West Midlands and northwest and centrally northern areas of England. It also appears to have declined southwest Scotland and the Isle of Man, though the species does seem to operate at the metapopulation level so local extinction and colonisation of new sites does occur frequently. That said, it no longer is as abundant as it was historically and more recent declined add to this. This bumblebee was subject to an English Nature Species Recovery Programme (until 2001), though it is not thought to be subject to conservation efforts at present.

The most threatening accepted population change estimate is -18.0% (raw record count), which does not exceed the 30% decline required for qualification as VU under Criterion A. Expert inference assessed this taxon as NT under projected threats due to sea level change projected landscape changes. The EoO (273,650 km²) exceeds the 20,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B1 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status, and the AoO (3,152 km²) exceeds the 2,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B2 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status. For Criterion D2, the number of locations was greater than 5 and there is no plausible threat that could drive the taxon to CR or RE in a very short time. No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.
