# Bombus subterraneus: iso. Cameron et al: 2007

## Provisional Red List status: RE
- A2 b

## Red List Justification
Previously declared regionally extinct, a reintroduction project was subsequently attempted. This project eventually released a number of queens into Dungeoness, but there is no evidence yet of success.
### Narrative
This species is closely related to B. distinguendus (females are markedly different but males can be challenging to separate) and could be considered a southern counterpart. A species of herb-rich grassland, strongly associated with pre-intensification farming practices, it was historically widespread especially south of the Severn to Wash line. The last confirmed records were from Dungeness in Kent (1988). A reintroduction project released 200 Swedish queens into Dungeness from 2012-16, but there was no evidence of success, despite targeted surveying to the present time (specimens initially identified as workers were later judged to be an atypical form of B. hortorum). It is known to be declining throughout much of Europe and is evaluated as RE for GB.
