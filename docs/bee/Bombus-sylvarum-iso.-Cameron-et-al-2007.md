# Bombus sylvarum: iso. Cameron et al: 2007
## Provisional status: VU
- B2 a,b, iii

## Justification
Data from first half of the 10-year period is significantly skewed by a period of high recorder activity.

Continuing development pressure in the Thames corridor is reducing continuity of habitat, and the taxon does not seem to do well in fragmented habitat. Development is considered to have had a overall detrimental effect.

Newport sites are under considerable development pressure, as are numerous other currently occupied brown field sites. Future habitat fragmentation is anticipated, weakening the population's stability.
