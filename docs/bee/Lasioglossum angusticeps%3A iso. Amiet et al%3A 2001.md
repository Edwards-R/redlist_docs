# Lasioglossum angusticeps: iso. Amiet et al: 2001

## Provisional Red List status: NT
- A2 b,c
- B1 a,b, 
- B2 a,b, 
- D2

## Red List Justification
Taxon is NT in the European Red List. Also, the cliff habitat has the potential for eutrophication due to leaching or slumping of substrate above nesting aggregations.
### Narrative
This solitary bee has a restricted coastal distribution, recorded from east Devon, Dorset and the Isle of Wight. The taxon is also NT in the European Red List. In addition, the cliff habitat has the potential for eutrophication due to leaching or slumping of substrate above nesting aggregations which could lead to localised losses.

No statistical methods were supportable under Criterion A due to low data volume. Expert inference assesses this taxon as LC based on suspected population change of the part 10 years. The EoO (3,350 km<sup>2</sup>) is below the 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> EN threshold for criterion B1 and the AoO (48 km<sup>2</sup>) is below the 500 km<sup>2</sup> EN threshold for criterion B2. Whilst there are 5 or fewer locations (EN), no further threat subcriteria could be established for this taxon, leaving the assessment under B as LC. For Criterion D2, whilst the number of locations was fewer or equal to 5, there is no plausible threat that could drive the taxon to CR or RE in a very short time. No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.

This taxon has been moderated to NT based on a combination of its status in the European Red List of NT and widespread yet highly localised threat to quality of habitat due to leaching or slumping of substrate above nesting aggregates. Peer review unanimously agreed upon an assessment of at least NT for this species.
