    # Lasioglossum prasinum: iso. Amiet et al: 2001

## Provisional Red List status: LC
- A2 b,c
- B1 a,b, 
- B2 a,b, 
- D2

## Red List Justification
*N/A*
### Narrative


The most threatening accepted population change estimate is 13.0% (discrete Extent of Occurrence), which does not exceed the 30% decline required for qualification as VU under Criterion A. The EoO (70,600 km²) exceeds the 20,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B1 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status, and the AoO (560 km²) is below the 2,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B2 but does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status. For Criterion D2, the number of locations was greater than 5 and there is no plausible threat that could drive the taxon to CR or RE in a very short time. No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.

### Criterion A2 (Statistical)
|Attribute|Assessment|Value|Accepted|Justification
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Raw record count|EN|-55%|No|Insufficient data suspected, decline not backed up by distribution or spread. The loss of a major recorder in the last 5-year period is suspected to be the cause.|
|AoO|VU|-38%|No|Insufficient data suspected, decline not backed up by distribution or spread. The loss of a major recorder in the last 5-year period is suspected to be the cause.|

### Criterion A2 (Expert Inference)
|Attribute|Assessment|Value|Accepted|Justification
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Internal review|LC|Huge numbers if in the right place at the right time, otherwise very sporadically found. Despite lower absolute record numbers, is being found at most known previous site and some new ones in the past 10 years. The loss of a major recorder of this taxon is noted, which is considered to be the leading cause of the decline in number of records.|Yes||
