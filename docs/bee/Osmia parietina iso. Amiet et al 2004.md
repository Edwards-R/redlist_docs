# Osmia parietina: iso. Amiet et al: 2004

## Provisional Red List status: NT
- A2b

## Red List Justification
Noticeably less found over the past 10 years during survey work.

### Narrative
This aerial nesting bee (often in stone crevices and walls) has a northwest bias and is restricted to the north and west of GB. Modern records are known from western and northern Wales, north-western England and southern and northern Scotland. It is strictly associated with legumes, usually on base-rich habitat (e.g. limestone grassland) with some shelter from trees / scrub. Records have declined in the last ten years, despite targeted, repeat surveys supporting an NT status. 

The are insufficient data to perform statistical assessment under Criterion A. Expert inference assessed this taxon as NT (decline does not exceed 30%, but there is evidence of concerning decline). The EoO (71,950 km²) exceeds the 20,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B1 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status, and the AoO (132 km²) is below the 500 km² EN threshold for criterion B2 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status. For Criterion D2, the number of locations was greater than 5 and there is no plausible threat that could drive the taxon to CR or RE in a very short time. No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.
