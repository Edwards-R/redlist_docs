However, expert inference noted that the taxon appears to be retreating northwards, even with the overall bias towards southern sampling present in the aculeates. The very low data volume makes any attempt at precise estimation impossible, though this inference was unanimously supported by wider peer review. The suspected mechanic for this shift is the warming climate, though again the details of how are unknown. Given the lack of data to support a 30% decline, coupled with the overall concern at a longer-term downward trend, this taxon has been placed in NT to encapsulate the inferred risk of continued decline as temperatures increase.

There is potential for *Vaccinium* to reach such low densities in the southern range of *A. lapponcia* that the region ceases to be able to support a viable population. Whilst reviewers noted that this taxon, and its food plant, remain common in northern areas of this assessment, the Red List criteria include *extent of habitat*. As such, the assessment of NT was maintained specifically under projected increased severity of this threat factor.

The EoO (249,350 km²) exceeds the 20,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B1 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status, and the AoO (1,204 km²) is below the 2,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B2 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status. For Criterion D2, the number of locations was greater than 5 and there is no plausible threat that could drive the taxon to CR or RE in a very short time. No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.

This medium sized solitary bee species has always been uncommon and localised south of the Severn to the Wash line. Even in areas with suitable habitat and favoured genus of forage plants (*Vaccinium* - usually *V. myrtillis*) there have been localised losses even in the core population areas and there is a risk of climate change reducing viable habitat areas and host plants."

However, expert inference noted a distinct decline in records from the south of England, which is typically the most well-sampled area for the aculeates. Such a decline is thought to be real, indicating the potential existence of a northward contraction due to changing climate. This finding was supported by the wider consultation of experts, with those in the south noting a decrease and those north of the midlands not yet noticing a decrease. The northern 'increase' is suspected to be the result of targeted survey effort in these areas, coupled with the overall increase in recording from Scotland (though record numbers are still very low overall from this region) Given the distinct regionality of the change, as well as the lack of widespread decline, this taxon has been placed in NT to encapsulate the inferred risk of continued decline as temperatures increase.

This bumblebee - very distinctive in the female sex - was historically widespread throughout GB but since the early twentieth century has rapidly declined. A species of extensive natural and semi-natural grassland mosaics which support a high density of flowering legumes, particularly common bird's-foot trefoil and red clover; such mosaics must contain nesting sites, forage areas and hibernation sites. The majority of habitat is at current sea level. In addition to loss of suitable legume-rich “crofting” habitat, rises to high water marks will destroy significant amounts of this habitat. If this destruction happens as part of a major event such as a storm surge, this taxon has limited ability to adapt or recolonise at many sites."

This taxon was moderated from LC to NT during peer review, with a majority of reviewers agreeing with NT over LC.

This - the largest of the Thoracobombus bumblebee species (which nest on the surface of the ground in) - has undergone a serious and extensive decline since the 1970’s. It is now very rare or absent from central and northwest England, whilst populations in South England and Wales are almost entirely coastal. Despite statistically coming out as LC, the wider review panel unanimously agreed it should be given NT status given the range and extent of decline. This species was previously a BAP species and has continued to show the decline common to many of the bumblebee species covered by this legislation."

This is one of four (of the five) much declined bumblebees of the Thoracobombus sub genus, the others being *B. muscorum, B. sylvarum* and *B. humilis*. There is a notable lack of data in last 5-year period which cannot be adequately explained (and does not show the same northward or southward contraction indicated for other declined bumblebees). There is always a risk of singular recorders not providing data, stopping recording etc, leading to shortfalls in data. However, a bumblebee experiencing a \~50% decline in records over a 10-year period is highly unusual. In some cases, identification can cause difficulties, but as bumblebees are undoubtedly the best recorded genus of bees the decline is likely to be accurate and the VU assessment warranted."

This taxon was moderated from LC to NT during peer review, during which there was a majority agreement that the taxon should be given a higher threat status, with multiple correspondents noting that they are personally finding it harder to find recently.

Although this bumblebee remains reasonably frequent in the Highlands of Scotland, this previously widespread species has become a rare bee in England and Wales. It remains at Salisbury Plain though has decreased and there are only 13 other scattered records for it, with most of those for Wales and northeast England. Much the decline has been historic, but there are also modern declines, with the pattern of decline seemingly continuing."

Although not related to *B. distinguendus*, the decline of this species - historically widespread throughout GB - is partly similar, in the loss of open, flower-rich habitat. However, there are likely to be other factors in it’s decline as it has retracted to seven areas in the southeast and southwest of England and South Wales. Continuing development pressure in the Thames corridor is reducing continuity of habitat, and the taxon does not seem to persist in fragmented habitat. Development is considered to have had an overall detrimental effect. Sites in South Wales are under considerable development pressure, as are numerous other currently occupied brown field sites. Future habitat fragmentation is anticipated, weakening the population's stability."

This a coastal bee (associated strongly with *Aster tripolium*) with almost the entirety of records historically for the east coast (Humber) to Hampshire. Despite a very recent range expansion to Avon, Cheshire (Wirral) and South Cumbria, all sites are at sea level, with minimal ability to rapidly adapt with sea level rise and storm events. The magnitude of impact will depend on the sea level mitigation measures, particularly in managed retreats of sea wall defences, though the UK nonetheless holds most of the European population of this species."

Historically well recorded and widely distributed in England (especially southern England from Cornwall to Kent, with other sites in Wales and Isles of Scilly), there has been a substantial decline in records of this solitary bee in the past few decades, especially in the southeast of England where it now appears to be rare. Modern records for northeast England and Scotland suggest the species is reacting to climactic changes."

No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.

This taxon has been moderated to NT due to its status of NT on the European Red List and the strict location requirement. Military training sites may also see distinct changes to flora and disturbance regimes under correct global conditions.

Modern records are confined to scattered sites on the three principal Army Ranges on Salisbury Plain. This solitary bee is monolectic (specifically associated) with *Onobrychis viciifolia*. Although the distribution of the associated plant - boosted considerably by introduced agricultural cultivars - is quite widespread in England (especially on chalk grassland), the species does not forage from cultivated varieties. The taxon is also NT on the European Red List."

This taxon was moderated from LC to NT during peer review, with the majority of correspondents believing that this taxon should really be assessed as VU. However, Red List guidance prohibits moderation by multiple levels, leaving NT as the highest possible threat status at this time.

Although given a provisional LC status in line with the statistical analyses, moderation has suggested that due to the small population area and some decline, NT would be more appropriate for this ground nesting, weevil hunting wasp."

Since the early assessment nomenclatural split of *M. littoralis* and *M. unicolor*, the distribution of this stem / root / ground nesting wasp is more clearly defined. Most British records originate from dune systems, where the species is associated with the dry marram zone of the “white dunes”. The more recently found Charmouth-Lyme Regis population appears to be associated with typical undercliff habitats: damp, bare clay with sparse vegetation and seepages supporting common reed. The major (west coast - particularly Wales) population lives in areas at risk of damage by major storm surges."

This mound nesting “wood ant” has undergone contraction of the range of especially in northern, central and eastern England and parts of Wales. Changes to woodland management practices have led to the decline and current management practices do not lead to suitable conditions for spread. These effects have been noted throughout GB by multiple experts, including directed survey efforts and academic projects."

Throughout the last decade, this social wasp (of no habitat affinity - habitats used include gardens) has dramatically decreased in southeast England (particularly) and elsewhere in GB, with its modern distribution considerably more fragmented. Given that the southern area of England has the greatest number and frequency of surveys, the absence is likely to be true. The reason for decline is unknown but could include climate instability."

This eumenine wasp is the only member of its genus in GB and has been regarded as a rarity from the 19th century to the present, with little change in population status. It is found entirely on heathland. The species has complex requirements, needing exposed ground with a clay content (as a nesting site), open water (to assist in nest building) and heathland rich in bell heather (for both nectar and prey foraging). The nest cells are provisioned with paralysed larvae of the moth *Acleris hyemana* (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). No other prey species has been recorded in Britain. Land management practices within the sole known, proximal locations are proving unfavourable, leading to decline in available habitat. This is backed up with transect data."

However, expert inference assesses this taxon at VU (30% decline via index of abundance appropriate to the taxon) based on the lack of data from the south and middle of England in very recent years. Examination of data from BWARS and iRecord shows a very strong picture of decline in frequency of recording within this region whilst other regions to the north remain relatively steady.  The clarity of this result is extremely surprising, given the convoluted nature of aculeate hymenoptera data, which provides the confidence to assess this taxon as VU rather than NT. The EoO (403,650 km²) exceeds the 20,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B1 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status, and the AoO (3,184 km²) exceeds the 2,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B2 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status.

A vespine wasp of open situations, most common in open woodlands, moorland and hedge banks, less commonly in urban situations and other habitats. This species was historically widespread and locally common throughout GB but has heavily declined in Southern and Central England ( more than 50% from areas south of London). As with *V. austriaca* - the parasite of this species - the strongest modern populations are in Scotland and the VU status has been applied to both the host and the parasite."
