However, expert inference noted that the taxon appears to be retreating northwards, even with the overall bias towards southern sampling present in the aculeates. The very low data volume makes any attempt at precise estimation impossible, though this inference was unanimously supported by wider peer review. The suspected mechanic for this shift is the warming climate, though again the details of how are unknown. Given the lack of data to support a 30% decline, coupled with the overall concern at a longer-term downward trend, this taxon has been placed in NT to encapsulate the inferred risk of continued decline as temperatures increase.

The EoO (367,650 km²) exceeds the 20,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B1 and does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status, and the AoO (496 km²) is below the 2,000 km² VU threshold for criterion B2 but does not satisfy sufficient subcriteria to reach a threat status.

This is a small solitary bee.  Though always local in GB it has become very localised and rare south of the Severn to the Wash line (except for Cornwall) despite higher sampling in this area."

This decline is expected to be produced by the warming climate reducing areas of suitability for *Vaccinium*, which is known to be highly responsive to such changes [(Hirabayashi et al, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157341).

This medium sized solitary bee species has always been uncommon and localised south of the Severn to the Wash line. Even in areas with suitable habitat and favoured genus of forage plants (Vaccinium – usually V. myrtillis) there have been localised losses even in the core population areas and there is a risk of climate change reducing viable habitat areas and host plants."

Always a very rare bee (the largest of 4 species in the Taeniandrena sub genus recorded for the UK) with 20th Century Records from 1950 – 1990 from only 2 locations. The 1950 record was from Somerset (Moorlinch – exact site unknown) – all other records from 1970 – 1990 were from the grassy bank of an old, abandoned railway line in Wiltshire (Burbage).

The inclusion of this bee on the British list rests on a female in the F. Smith Collection in the University Museum, Oxford. The only documentation carried on the pin is “16.8.”. According to R.C.L. Perkins (1914) the specimen was probably sent to Smith by J.B. Bridgman of Norwich as the pin, mode of setting and label is similar to that of other Andrena species known to have been sent by him to Smith in the period 1875-77.

However, expert inference noted a distinct decline in records from the south of England, which is typically the most well-sampled area for the aculeates. Such a decline is thought to be real, indicating the potential existence of a northward contraction due to changing climate. This finding was supported by the wider consultation of experts, with those in the south noting a decrease and those north of the midlands not yet noticing a decrease. The northern 'increase' is suspected to be the result of targeted survey effort in these areas, coupled with the overall increase in recording from Scotland (though record numbers are still very low overall from this region) Given the distinct regionality of the change, as well as the lack of widespread decline, this taxon has been placed in NT to encapsulate the inferred risk of continued decline as temperatures increase.

Historically this species (superficially similar to the much more common A. plumipes) was well recorded in southern England - from Dorset to Kent, north to Oxfordshire, and East Norfolk. Over more recent decades this bee has undergone a rapid and largely unexplained decline in Britain. In the last two decades it has been reliably recorded from just six sites in Dorset, Isle of Wight, North Hampshire, East Sussex and North Essex. A large area of known nesting habitat in East Sussex was destroyed in one summer storm, leading to substantial population reduction. The taxon is considered to be recovering but is at risk of repeat events."

In addition to loss of suitable legume-rich “crofting” habitat, rises to high water marks will destroy significant amounts of this habitat.

Always a restricted bee, almost entirely restricted to north of the Severn-Wash line (with records for Dartmoor in the southwest only) the species has undergone significant population decrease in certain core areas including the West Midlands and northwest and centrally northern areas of England. It also appears to have declined southwest Scotland and the Isle of Man, though the species does seem to operate at the metapopulation level so local extinction and colonisation of new sites does occur frequently. That said, it no longer is as abundant as it was historically and more recent declined add to this. This bumblebee was subject to an English Nature Species Recovery Programme (until 2001), though it is not thought to be subject to conservation efforts at present."

This taxon was moderated from LC to NT during peer review, with a majority of reviewers agreeing with NT over LC.

This – the largest of the Thoracobombus bumblebee species (which nest on the surface of the ground in) – has undergone a serious and extensive decline since the 1970’s. It is now very rare or absent from central and northwest England, whilst populations in South England and Wales are almost entirely coastal. Despite statistically coming out as LC, the wider review panel unanimously agreed it should be given NT status given the range and extent of decline.

This is one of four much declined bumblebees of the Thoracobombus sub genus (of which only one is common and widespread), the others being B. muscorum, B. sylvarum and B. humilis. There is a notable lack of data in last 5-year period which cannot be adequately explained (and does not show the same northward or southward contraction indicated for other declined bumblebees). There is always a risk of singular recorders not providing data, stopping recording etc, leading to shortfalls in data. However, a bumblebee experiencing a ~50% decline in records over a 10-year period is highly unusual. In some cases, identification can cause difficulties, but as bumblebees are undoubtedly the best recorded genus of bees the decline is likely to be accurate and the VU assessment warranted."

This taxon was moderated from LC to NT during peer review, during which there was a majority agreement that the taxon should be given a higher threat status, with multiple correspondents noting that they are personally finding it harder to find recently.

Although this bumblebee remains reasonably frequent in the Highlands of Scotland, this previously widespread species has become a rare bee in England and Wales. It remains at Salisbury Plain though has decreased and there are only 13 other scattered records for it, with most of those for Wales and northeast England. Much the decline has been historic, but there are also modern declines, with the pattern of decline seemingly continuing."

This species is closely related to B. distinguendus (females are markedly different but males can be challenging to separate) and could be considered a southern counterpart. A species of herb-rich grassland, strongly associated with pre-intensification farming practices, it was historically widespread especially south of the Severn to Wash line. The last confirmed records were from Dungeness in Kent (1988). A reintroduction project released 200 Swedish queens into Dungeness from 2012-16, but there was no evidence of success, despite targeted surveying to the present time (specimens initially identified as workers were later judged to be an atypical form of B. hortorum). It is known to be declining throughout much of Europe and is evaluated as RE for GB."

Although not related to B. distinguendus, the decline of this species – historically widespread throughout GB – is partly similar, at least in terms of the the loss of open, flower-rich habitat, though with a different geographic retraction. There are likely to be other factors in the decline of this species as it has retracted to seven areas in the southeast and southwest of England and South Wales. Continuing development pressure in the Thames corridor is reducing continuity of habitat, and the taxon does not seem to persist in fragmented habitat. Development is considered to have had an overall detrimental effect. Sites in South Wales are under considerable development pressure, as are numerous other currently occupied brown field sites. Future habitat fragmentation is anticipated, weakening the population's stability."

This distinctly northern solitary bee only has modern GB records for Cumbria (where it haslways been very rare) and the west coast of Scotland (especially on the islands). The associated habitats are coastal sand dunes and, in the Western Isles, the machair (a maritime grassland typical of the Hebrides, comprising a rich flowering sward established on wind-blown shell sand). Most sea-level dune systems used are vulnerable to a single Atlantic storm system. Climate change predictions tend towards a higher intensity and frequency of Atlantic storm systems. These storms have significant potential to cause substantial damage to the existing population and available habitat. This taxon is montane in southern areas of Europe and may respond negatively to climate change."

This is a coastal bee (associated strongly with Aster tripolium) with almost the entirety of records historically for the east coast (Humber) to Hampshire. Despite a very recent range expansion to Avon, Cheshire (Wirral) and South Cumbria, all sites are at sea level, with minimal ability to rapidly adapt with sea level rise and storm events. The magnitude of impact will depend on the sea level mitigation measures, particularly in managed retreats of sea wall defences, though the UK nonetheless holds most of the European population of this species."

This taxon has been moderated to NT based on a combination of its status in the European Red List of NT and widespread yet highly localised threat to quality of habitat due to leaching or slumping of substrate above nesting aggregates. Peer review unanimously agreed upon an assessment of at least NT for this species.

This solitary bee has a restricted coastal distribution, recorded from east Devon, Dorset and the Isle of Wight. The taxon is also NT in the European Red List. In addition, the cliff habitat has the potential for eutrophication due to leaching or slumping of substrate above nesting aggregations which could lead to localised losses."

Historically this was a widespread if localised species, found throughout GB. It has heavily declined in most of southern and central England, where it was found on lowland heaths. The last record for Surrey was 1973 and the last record for Surrey was 1974 - overall, suspected >80% decline in observation in southeastern England.

This taxon has been moderated to NT due to its status of NT on the European Red List and the strict location requirement. Military training sites may also see distinct changes to flora and disturbance regimes under correct global conditions.

Modern records are confined to scattered sites on the three principal Army Ranges on Salisbury Plain. This solitary bee is monolectic (specifically associated) with Onobrychis viciifolia. Although the distribution of the associated plant – boosted considerably by introduced agricultural cultivars - is quite widespread in England (especially on chalk grassland), the species does not forage from cultivated varieties. The taxon is also NT on the European Red List."

It is currently assumed to be isolated due to a combination of host availability fragmentation, and the small size of the only known parasitised colony. The colony is unable to reach a size where random chance reaches a point where dispersal results in the finding of a new host colony.

This taxon has been moderated from VU to EN on the basis of peri and post assessment repeat, targeting survey efforts failing to provide as much data as was expected under higher scrutiny. Existing locations were assessed to be continuing to decline in suitability, with no significant change from the previous assessment, leading to further threat of habitat loss.

This megachilid bee is very rare, being confined to the central Scottish Highlands on base-rich pasture with legumes and woodland edge habitat with Bugle and Bilberry. This taxon requires specific targeted survey effort. No such survey has happened in the 10-year assessment period. Due to the paucity of data and lack of knowledge, it was not possible to place this taxon in any higher threat status than VU. Taking into account wider knowledge, which has no place to be captured under the available rules, the threat status to this taxon should be much higher. Even when subjected to targeted survey effort, records have been scarce. Existing locations were at risk of conversion to commercial pine forest or subject to inappropriate grazing. The pressures from the last targeted work are considered to have been maintained. This species is therefore considered to be under far higher threat than can be captured within the Red List methodology."

This aerial nesting bee (often in stone crevices and walls) has a northwest bias and is restricted to the north and west of GB. Modern records are known from western and northern Wales, north-western England and southern and northern Scotland. It is strictly associated with legumes, usually on base-rich habitat (e.g. limestone grassland) with some shelter from trees / scrub.

This megachilid bee nest in dead wood, often in open woodland (especially on chalky soils). Lack of traditional coppice management and over-zealous woodland management has reduced suitable habitat, and the range of the species has retracted substantially from numerous sites south of the Severn – Wash line to very few sites in Kent and Sussex during the assessment period. The taxon has been subjected to targeted survey effort yet cannot be re-found on many previous sites. Forestry management practices used to provide a range of suitable nesting habitats, but these practices have changed. Deadwood and stumps are now routinely destroyed via mechanical management, removing nesting opportunities. "

Following assessment, this taxon was subject to significant targeted survey efforts to attempt to re-find the Isle of Wight population. This population's existence was the deciding factor between EN and CR during assessment. The population could not be re-found over multiple visits and review of specimens, with the assessment that this subpopulation is likely extinct. Accordingly, this taxon has been elevated to CR.

Historically (pre-1950’s) this distinctive megachilid bee was recorded from 28 scattered localities from the south coast of England to Tyneside. Following the loss of the Isle of Wight colony in the early assessment period, there remains a singular existing colony in North Wales which is at risk of localised storm surges damaging the nesting site. Pastures above the nesting location cliffs are being improved, resulting in enrichment of the area and reducing forage resource. These measures result in the taxon reaching EN status. The Isle of Wight population cannot be found, reducing the known viable locations to one. Farming practices place additional pressure upon the remaining known site, specifically regarding availability of suitable floral resource. For these reasons, this taxon is elevated to CR."

This taxon was moderated from LC to NT during peer review, with the majority of correspondents believing that this taxon should really be assessed as VU. However, Red List guidance prohibits moderation by multiple levels, leaving NT as the highest possible threat status at this time.

Although given a provisional LC status in line with the statistical analyses, moderation has suggested that due to the small population area and some decline, NT would be more appropriate for this ground nesting, weevil hunting wasp."

This taxon was moderated to NT during peer review where the majority of respondants agreed that this taxon had become far harder to find during field survey.

The most restricted species of this genus of solitary wasps (which often nest in dead wood or stems and hunt Diptera); discovered in 1972 and known only from east Hampshire (north to the Surrey border) and West Sussex. No threat could be established to warrant the use of threat criteria under assessment. However, expert inference suggests a level of decline that matches their experiences."

Since the early assessment nomenclatural split of M. littoralis and M. unicolor, the distribution of this stem / root / ground nesting wasp is more clearly defined. Most British records originate from dune systems, where the species is associated with the dry marram zone of  “white dune” areas. The more recently found Charmouth-Lyme Regis population appears to be associated with typical undercliff habitats: damp, bare clay with sparse vegetation and seepages supporting common reed. The major (west coast – particularly Wales) population lives in areas at risk of damage by major storm surges."

This taxon was moderated from LC to NT during peer review, with multiple reviewers believing that the taxon should be assessed at a higher threat status than it currently is. However, under the Red List guidance and current knowledge, a higher threat status is impossible to obtain.

This small, spider-hunting wasp black wasp - not a pompilid wasp but a crabronid wasp predator of smaller spiders than pompilids – is restricted to two populations on coastal dunes in Kent and East Sussex.  Both populations exist on narrow strips of coastal land. Both locations are highly vulnerable to the same large storm surge, with little potential surrounding habitat to retreat to."

This “wood ant” builds smaller nests than the other mound nesting species of the genus and nests have been found in open heath or moor, as well as woodland rides and clearings, and roadside verges. The distribution has always been disjunct and limited to the south coast of England and the Scottish Highlands but is much declined in England and to a lesser extent in Scotland. For the main (Scottish) population it requires a maintained amount of successional edge habitat in woodland. As such it has a potential management conflict with Capercaillie, with which it shares a geographic region. The Capercaillie requires denser continuous forest cover than this taxon."

This ant – a specialist of wet lowland heath – has always been restricted to South Wales and southern counties of England (Dorset, Hampshire and Surrey). It has disappeared from several of its former sites and is vulnerable to changes in hydrology, as well as vegetation succession. It may be under-recorded in known locations due to confusion with other species in the Serviformica sub genus but there is no evidence it occurs anywhere else in GB."

This mound nesting “wood ant” has undergone contraction of the range of especially in northern, central and eastern England and parts of Wales. Changes to woodland management practices have contributed to decline and current woodland management practices do not lead to suitable conditions for spread.

This mound nesting ant has always been very rare in the British Isles: all well-substantiated records are from Surrey and the Isles of Scilly. The mainland population is threatened by development (1 colony was lost when a manhole cover was replaced), while the Scilly population has a threat of increased vegetational growth reducing nesting viability.

This small ant, with a correspondingly small nest, is associated with heathland and particularly lichen heath.

It has been the subject of targeted survey effort without the discovery of new sites and is highly susceptible to localised events such as storm surges and vegetation succession.

This spider-hunting wasp has always been a rare heathland species with records confined to Dorset, Hampshire and Surrey, though there were no records for it between 1953 and the early 2000's. Incredibly difficult to detect, even if it is readily identified once seen. Modern records predominantly result from one surveyor using flower lures in south England. Further autecological work is required to understand the potential impact of threats. Major wildfires on lowland heathland may be of concern, but the impact and scale of such fires is currently not understood."

Always a widespread but rarely recorded species in GB, the last confirmed record of this eumenine wasp pre-dates the current Red-list assessment period (17/06/1989). There is a reported specimen from Greenwich Peninsula Ecology Park from surveys conducted by David Notton for British Museum for Natural History (BMNH; 2016-17 – Steven Falk internal review comment). David Notton passed all Vespidae specimens to Michael Archer for determination, then deposited them in the BNHM collection. The specimen can’t be traced (Gavin Broad, Senior Curator at BNHM, pers. comm. and Jaswinder Boparai, volunteer curator at BNHM pers. comm.). This, combined with targeted, unsuccessful survey effort in other areas during the Red List period, leads to evaluation as RE."

 V. little is known about the biology of this very localised eumenine wasp. It has always been entirely restricted to marshy areas of East Anglia and was regarded as extinct between some historic Essex records and its rediscovery in 1986. It has been recorded in East Anglia in the assessment period – however, it feeds on a weevil associated with aquatic Apium, which is a genus of freshwater plants. The multiple, adjacent, East Anglian sites are at risk of a single storm surge bringing saline inundation, which would damage the prey's host plant.

No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.

This eumenine wasp is the only member of its genus in GB and has been regarded as a rarity from the 19th century to the present, with little change in population status. It is found entirely on heathland. The species has complex requirements, needing exposed ground with a clay content (as a nesting site), open water (to assist in nest building) and heathland rich in bell heather (for both nectar and prey foraging). The nest cells are provisioned with paralysed larvae of the moth Acleris hyemana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). No other prey species has been recorded in Britain. Land management practices within the sole known, proximal locations - a few heathland sites in the Poole Basin of south-east Dorset - are proving unfavourable, leading to decline in available habitat. This is backed up with transect data."

This taxon has a complete dependency upon *Vespula rufa*: iso. Archer: 1989, which is assessed as VU. A host with a singular dependency may be no less threatened than that dependency, and so this taxon is assessed as VU.

This is the only parasitic wasp in the subfamily Vespinae, being associated with Vespula rufa. It has always been scarcer than its host, very rare south of the Severn – Wash line and with v. few early assessment records for England and Wales (where it is likely extinct in many places). Populations are probably stable in the Scottish Highlands, but it would be reasonable to expect that this species is unlikely to recover lost populations further south in the future."

However, expert inference assesses this taxon at VU (30% decline via index of abundance appropriate to the taxon) based on the lack of data from the south and middle of England in very recent years. Examination of data from BWARS and iRecord shows a very strong picture of decline in frequency of recording within this region whilst other regions to the north remain relatively steady.  The clarity of this result is extremely surprising, given the convoluted nature of aculeate hymenoptera data, which provides the confidence to assess this taxon as VU rather than NT.

A vespine wasp of open situations, most common in open woodlands, moorland and hedge banks, less commonly in urban situations and other habitats. This species was historically widespread and locally common throughout GB but has heavily declined in Southern and Central England ( more than 50% from areas south of London). As with V. austriaca - the parasite of this species – the strongest modern populations are in Scotland and the VU status has been applied to both the host and the parasite."
