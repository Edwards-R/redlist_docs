# Glossary

## Buffer-Union
A model designed to measure discrete extent of occurrence. The algorithm works by drawing a 40 km buffer around each provided point and then combining the resulting polygons.

## BWARS
The UK Bees Wasps & Ants Recording Society. Responsible for managing the nomenclature used for the assessment taxa, as well as acting as a collation point for multiple independent recording systems across the assessment area.

## Eligibility assessment
Determines where the taxon is eligible for inclusion within the Red List. Assesses colonisation state, vagrancy, and any [synanthropic](#synanthropic-colonisation) elements.

## Internal review
The first [review stage](#review-stage) of this assessment.

## Internal review team
The three people responsible for conducting the internal review.

## Model
A model is a form of data analysis, not limited to any particular method. The main examples of models utilised in this analysis are:

- Expert opinion
- Bayesian occupancy
- Raw data
- Buffer union
- Specialist review
- Frescalo

Keep in mind that, once a model is defined for an assessment, every taxon in that assessment must be assessed against the model in the exact same manner. Assessments against models are defined by [model assessments](#model-assessment).

## Model Assessment
The assessment of a given [model](#model) under a given Red List criterion. For example, the assessment of `Buffer Union` under `A2`. The criterion may be specified down to any applicable sub-level, e.g. `A2 b`, at the discretion of the assessor. Keep in mind that once a model assessment is defined, every taxon in the assessment **must** be assessed against that model assessment. It is not permitted to define taxon-specific model assessments.

## Nomenclatural Change
A nomenclatural change is when the name utilised for a [nomenclatural understanding](#nomenclatural-understanding) changes. For example, in 2008 the name *Bombus lucorum* in the assessment area was split into *Bombus lucorum*, *Bombus magnus*, and *Bombus cryptarum*. This is not a *taxonomic* change as no types were created nor modified. A taxonomic change creates a nomenclatural change, but a nomenclatural change does not create a taxonomic change.

## Nomenclatural Understanding
A method of keeping track of the evolution of taxonomic nomenclature over time without resulting in confusion or loss of data. An example of how they work can be found at https://github.com/Edwards-R/Understanding_Example.

Nomenclatural Understandings can be ignored and the binomial utilised instead by the majority of users, unless the taxon is subject to a recent nomenclatural change. In order to identify recent nomenclatural changes, the BWARS website should be consulted as a first step. If this does not resolve your query, contact BWARS directly.

## Occupancy status
The occupancy status refers to how the subject experts view the subject taxon's presence in the assessed area. This is assessed via two vectors:

Vagrancy vs non-vagrancy
Synanthropic vs non-synanthropic colonisation

Each taxon should be assessed via both of these.

## Red List Steering Group
A group of independent people responsible for the final quality control checks on the project. Anyone from this group may step in at any time to observe and comment.

## Review Assessment
A review assessment is created by the examination of a number of [model assessments](#model-assessment) to arrive at a conclusion.

The outcome of a review assessment may be considered a [model assessment](#model-assessment) in its own right, typically as the outcome for a [review stage](#review-stage).

As a worked example, the [model assessments](#model-assessment) performed in the `initial` stage of this review cover assessing the [models](#model) for raw data, buffer-union, bayesian occupancy, and expert opinion. Once these have been assessed by their respective [model assessments](#model-assessment), a review assessment is performed to coalesce the various results down to a singular threat status that the review process deems to be the correct decision.

## Review Stage
A collection of [model assessments](#model-assessment) which result in a [review assessment](#review-assessment), each of which feeds in the next.

In this assessment, these stages are:
- Initial
- Wider
- Final

Each stage has a defined reponsibility for the assessment. The initial review is concerned with the interpretation of the statistical [models](#model) and sourcing of initial expert opinion. The `wider` stage is concerned with displaying the result of the `initial` stage to a wider panel and sourcing that panel's opinions via a set of expert opinion [models](#model). The third stage is designed for raising any concerns from outside opinions that were not adequately captured by the `wider` stage, as well as giving the steering group an opportunity to perform final quality assurance.

## Ruling
A ruling is defined in this project as guidance on the assessment of taxa which **must** be followed. Specifically, a ruling is generated
- when a decision must be made when following the **Guidance** documentation
- when the guidance documentation must be in interpreted to maintain applicability to taxa 

## Slice
A 'slice' refers to a time slice. The time slices for this assessment are, date-inclusive:

|Name|Start|End|
|---|---|---|
|Slice 1|1992|2001|
|Slice 2|2002|2011|
|Slice 3|2012|2021|

An additional set of 'sub slices' have been created to allow expert opinion to act with greater detail than at 10 year resolution. These sub-slices are 5 year divisions of the main slices:

|Name|Start|End|
|---|---|---|
|Slice 2a|2002|2006|
|Slice 2b|2007|2011|
|Slice 3a|2012|2026|
|Slice 3b|2017|2021|

## Synanthropic colonisation
Synanthropic colonisation refers to a species colonising an area via the assistance of humans. AN example of this would be a stem-nesting taxon arriving via thatching reeds imported from Poland.

## Vagrant
A vagrant is a taxon which has not established long-term presence in the assessment area, and any extant population at the time of assessment is not predicted by the subject experts to continue for significant time.

## Wider review
The second [review stage](#review-stage) of this assessment, where the [internal review](#internal-review) is sent out for peer review by the [wider review team](#wider-review-team).

## Wider review team
A collection of taxon-specific subject experts chosen by the [internal review team](#internal-review-team) to peer review the internal review.
