# Homonotus sanguinolentus: iso. Day: 1988

## Provisional Red List status: EN
- B1ab(iii)
- B2ab(iii)

## Red List Justification
Land management practices within the major known location are proving unfavourable, leading to decline in available habitat.

### Narrative
Records of this highly distinctive spider-hunting wasp are confined to a small number of heathland sites in southern England, with modern records restricted to lowland heath and valley mires in Hampshire and Dorset. It is an elusive species which targets the covered, silken nests of the spider Cheiracanthium erraticum (Clubionidae). Land management practices within the major known locations are proving unfavourable, leading to decline in available habitat.

No statistical assessment was possible under Criterion A due insufficient data. Expert inference assessed this taxon as VU under future threat on the basis of peri- and post-assessment targeted surveys of known sites. The EoO (2,700 km²) is below the 5,000 km² EN threshold for criterion B1 and the AoO (44 km²) is below the 500 km² EN threshold for criterion B2. There are fewer or equal to 5 locations, and continuing/projected decline in area, extent & quality of habitat. For Criterion D2, the number of locations was fewer or equal to 5, but there is no plausible threat of rapid habitat loss that could drive the taxon to CR or RE in a very short time. No information was available on population size to inform assessments against Criteria C and D1; nor were any life-history models available to inform an assessment against Criterion E.
