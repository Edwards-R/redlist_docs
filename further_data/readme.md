# Further Data Review
This section covers the request from Natural England to 'use more data'. This idea of 'use all the data we can find' has been strenuously resisted by the Red List core team, as 'more' data does not equate to a 'better' result. The data being assessed here are *highly* vulnerable to vast biases and faults introduced from individual incorrect records. This arises from the sparsity of good quality, trustable data, coupled with the reliance on absolute area criteria for many taxa (Criteria B especially) being the only supportable metrics.

Accordingly, the dataset being assessed in this sectioned consists of the following:

- The BWARS dataset, as of 2024-11-01
- The EFC dataset where nomenclature could be resolved
- All iRecord records marked `Correct` or `Considered Correct` where nomenclature could be resolve

## Modernisation of Nomenclature
No post-assessment splits will be considered. Understandings will be used to firmly fix in place any potential divergences. This method is selected as it will enable direct comparison with the 'core' Red List, as well as the fact that Understandings remove all nomenclatural uncertainty by design.

## Process
Reviews of the Core team will be presented, for each taxon:
- A map of the distribution of the taxon, in QGIS, containing the following:
  - The Red List dataset
  - The Red List *Further Data* dataset
  - The BWARS dataset for
    - Pre-assessment
    - Assessment
    - Post-assessment
- A copy of the Red List assesment data, in the same format, minus the CEH models of Frescalo and Bayesian Occupancy
