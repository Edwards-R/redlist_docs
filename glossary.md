# Glossary

### BWARS
The UK Bees Wasps & Ants Recording Society. Responsible for managing the nomenclature used for the assessment taxa, as well as acting as a collation point for multiple independent recording systems across the assessment area.

### Model
A model is a form of data analysis, not limited to any particular method. The main examples of models utilised in this analysis are:

- Expert opinion
- Bayesian occupancy
- Raw data
- Buffer union
- Specialist review
- Frescalo

### Nomenclatural Understanding
A method of keeping track of the evolution of taxonomic nomenclature over time without resulting in confusion or loss of data. An example of how they work can be found at https://github.com/Edwards-R/Understanding_Example.

Nomenclatural Understandings can be ignored and the binomial utilised instead by the majority of users, unless the taxon is subject to a recent nomenclatural change. In order to identify recent nomenclatural changes, the BWARS website should be consulted as a first step. If this does not resolve your query, contact BWARS directly.

### Occupancy status
The occupancy status refers to how the subject experts view the subject taxon's presence in the assessed area. This is assessed via two vectors:

Vagrancy vs non-vagrancy
Synanthropic vs non-synanthropic colonisation

Each taxon should be assessed via both of these.

### Ruling
A ruling is defined in this project as guidance on the assessment of taxa which **must** be followed.

### Synanthropic colonisation
Synanthropic colonisation refers to a species colonising an area via the assistance of humans. AN example of this would be a stem-nesting taxon arriving via thatching reeds imported from Poland.

### Vagrant
A vagrant is a taxon which has not established long-term presence in the assessment area, and any extant population at the time of assessment is not predicted by the subject experts to continue for significant time.
