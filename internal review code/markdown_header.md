# Taxon Understanding
## Provisional status: *tbc status here*

## Justification
*Any information regarded as central to the justification of the provisional status. Note that this may not contain all information in full detail*
## QA Metrics
*Quality Assurance metrics, used to gauge the health of the data being fed into the statistical analysis. In general, `# Records` should be > 100/decade (50/5-year) and `BU%A` should be >=80%/decade (>=70%/5-year). There are multiple scenarios where these numbers, especially the `# records` may be changed, but `BU%A` remains overall very stable.*
### Decade
| Slice | # Records | BU%A |
|---|---|---|
|1992 - 2001|--|--%|
|2002 - 2011|--|--%|
|2012 - 2021|--|--%|
### 5-year
| Slice | # Records | BU%A |
|---|---|---|
|2002 - 2006|--|--%|
|2007 - 2011|--|--%|
|2012 - 2016|--|--%|
|2017 - 2021|--|--%|
## Criterion assessment
*The results of all assessments against a given criteria. A value of `?` denotes a 'divide by zero' result and should be regarded as equivalent to `NaN` (Not a Number). Assessments are headed by the criteria they are scored against, with additional separation of non-statistical assessments*

|Attribute|Assessment|Value|Accepted|Justification

|*The attribute being tested. E.g. Area of Occupancy, continuous Extent of Occurrence, and discrete Extent of Occurrence*|*The status returned by this particular test e.g. 'VU'*|*The criterion-appropriate value returned by the test e.g. '-21%'*|*Did the internal review team believe that the statistical requirements of the model used are fulfilled? (Yes/No)*|*If the statistical requirements are not believed to be fulfilled, this explains why e.g. 'Insufficient data'*|
