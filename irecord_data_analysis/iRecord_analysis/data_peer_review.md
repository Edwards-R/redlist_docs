# iRecord data verification peer review <!-- omit from toc -->

## Introduction
A selection of records which were identified as being out of expected bounds were sent to an experienced verifier and data handler for a second opinion. The two sets of data identified were:

- All records which failed to pass the temporal boundary check process
- All verification status 2 'Correct' records which failed to pass the spatial boundary check process

Note that, in order to reach the boundary checking processes, the data must have passed through the BWARS Checker.

The re-verifier was asked to complete the iRecord verification status, using the BWARS version of the iRecord verification status 2 criteria:

- **Correct**: The verifier is able to confirm that the species has been identified correctly, usually on the basis of photo/s within iRecord (or specimen/s outside iRecord)
- **Considered correct**: The verifier has not seen photo/s or specimen/s (or the photograph is inadequate) but has a high degree of confidence that the record is likely to be correct, based on difficulty of ID, date, location and recorder skills/experience etc.
- **Unable to verify**: The verifier has a high degree of confidence that the record is likely to be incorrect based on difficulty of ID, date, location and recorder skills/experience (and where no photo/s or specimen/s are available); or photos are available but do not show enough detail to confirm the identification; and/or the record is not sufficiently well documented to confirm (e.g. location is vague or the date appears to be incorrect)
- **Incorrect**: The verifier is able to confirm that the species has not been identified correctly, or the record is erroneous in other respects, on the basis of photo/s or specimen/s, or on information from the recorder
- **Plausible**: The record is plausible based on species, date and location, but there is not enough supporting evidence for the possibility of misidentification to be ruled out, and the record remains within the "Unconfirmed" category

## Temporal range checking
1,202 temporal outliers were supplied. Of these, 886 were re-verified.
