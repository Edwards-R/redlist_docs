## Introduction
This document details an assessment and comparison of the BWARS and iRecord Aculeate Hymenopteran datasets, with a view to incorporating iRecord data into a regional Red List assessment.

### Why check data so carefully?
Due to the assessment processes of the Red List, combined with the manner in which data are collected, great emphasis is placed on maintaining a very high quality of data. There are a great many taxa within the area of interest which are under-recorded. The under-recording typically results from a lack of people with the requisite time and enthusiasm to devote years to honing identification skills to the level required to be proficient enough to reach an acceptably low level of error. As such, the small volume of high quality data being output by the skilled contingent is at high risk of being drowned out by large volumes of lower-skilled collectors. The consequences for data-drowning are severe and, in many cases, immediately impactful. Since the Red List protocol utilises a form of occupancy for the majority of Aculeate Hymenoptera assessments, small volumes of incorrect data can have vastly disproportionate impacts upon Red List criteria.

The BWARS (Bees Wasps and Ants) data has gone through a significant quality control process, including:

- Translation to safe nomenclature storage (Understandings)
- Human bulk-volume examination of data
- Personal assessment of contributors' ability to identify taxa
- Automated temporal range checking
- Automated spatial range checking
- Directed outlier verification
- Ongoing querying and resolution of potential errors in individual records

This project aims to bring as much of that quality control process to the iRecord data set. Doing so will advance our knowledge on:

- How complete the BWARS dataset is
- How complete the iRecord dataset is
- What iRecord data could be used for in future Red List Aculeate Hymenoptera assessments
- Areas for improvement in both BWARS and iRecord

### What is contained
Contained within is the documentation and results for the various assessments and comparisons of the iRecord and BWARS datasets. At the end is a conclusion, where the project findings are summarised for presentation to the Red List core team. The core team, being subject experts, are then given the responsibility of deciding what data, if any, should be included for a parallel Red List assessment.
