# iRecord Notes
A place for me to write notes on data exploration/topics which are not strictly part of the Red List process.

## 'Orphan' verification status 1 data
An odd one. It looks like the 'BWARS affiliate' team stopped causing errors with this after 2020-01-06, but there's still someone using verification status 1 only in a batched mode on 2022-05-20. After this, only one record uses verification status 1 rather than 2.
