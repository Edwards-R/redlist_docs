# Notes

## Word & FAIR
Write in .md, convert to Word

## USKI & Understandings
Work with understandings, match as best as possible. Hopefully this is after we've updated the UKSI.

## Synonymy
Use Understandings

## Vernacular
Don't do this

## Nativeness
Covered by synanthropic ruling

## Endemics
Note that there are none, do not output attribute

## NA/NE/RE/EX
If on list, 'assess' them? Make judgement of 'NA' if they're 'strange'.

## Non-applicable models
Assign to false model and rate as DD. Or say up front that `All species were considered against all criteria`.

## Previous Reviews
See what format Falk is in and if it can be digitised

## GB Rarity status
Make status for each. Will workshop what we call them afterwards.

Make sure there is a ruling that lays out exactly how this is performed.

Discard synanthropic as NA

## Generation time
No, stick with 10 year assessment period

## Population metrics
No possible, explain why in documentation

## Flags
SF - Add it in, make a ruling for its strict application

EF - None applicable, don't put in

CD - Add it, pull from B subcriteria

## Extinct
30 years with targeted survey effort
50 years without specific effort

## NT
Add `NT` as a valid step during moderation. LC or VU may be moderated to `NT`
