# Model Assessment
The definintion of a model assessment can be found [here](./glossary.md#model-assessment).

This document states which Red List criteria can be used for each model, sourced from the [list of applicable criteria](./criteria.md). Since the Red List requires that every assessment use every criterion, this document will establish which ot the applicable criteria can be applied to which model.

## Raw Data
| Criterion | Used | Comment |
| --- |--- |---|
| A2 | Yes | Record numbers are an index of abudance appropriate to the taxon. Tetrad area is Area of Occupancy |
| A3 | No | No future predictions are made by this model |
| B1 | No | No applicable metric |
| B2 | Yes | Tetrad area is considered base data |

## Buffer Union
| Criterion | Used | Comment |
| --- |--- |---|
| A2 | Yes | Buffer union is EoO and an index of abudance appropriate to the taxon |
| A3 | No | No future predictions are made by this model |
| B1 | Yes | Buffer union is the means by which dEoO is calculated |
| B2 | No | Model does not address AoO |

## Bayesian Occupancy
| Criterion | Used | Comment |
| --- |--- |---|
| A2 | Yes | Model is an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon |
| A3 | No | No future predictions are made by this model |
| B1 | No | Model does not address dEoO |
| B2 | No | Model does not address AoO |

## Frescalo
| Criterion | Used | Comment |
| --- |--- |---|
| A2 | Yes | Model is an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon |
| A3 | No | No future predictions are made by this model |
| B1 | No | Model does not address dEoO |
| B2 | No | Model does not address AoO |

## Internal Expert Opinion
| Criterion | Used | Comment |
| --- |--- |---|
| A2 | Yes | Expert sampling is considered an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon |
| A3 | Yes | Expert knowledge on potential future causes of a reduction in AoO, dEoO, and/or habitat quality |
| B1 | No | Expert opinion does not have exact figures, which are required by this criterion |
| B2 | No | Expert opinion does not have exact figures, which are required by this criterion |

## Wider Expert Opinion
| Criterion | Used | Comment |
| --- |--- |---|
| A2 | Yes | Expert sampling is considered an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon |
| A3 | Yes | Expert knowledge on potential future causes of a reduction in AoO, dEoO, and/or habitat quality |
| B1 | No | Expert opinion does not have exact figures, which are required by this criterion |
| B2 | No | Expert opinion does not have exact figures, which are required by this criterion |
