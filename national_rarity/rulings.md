# National Rarity Rulings
This document contains the rules by which National Rarities may differ from the strict application of the method.

## Default classification
The default classification is as follows:

|Classification|Abbreviation|Criteria|
|---|---|---|
|Nationally Rare|NR| # tetrads <= 15|
|Nationally Scarce|NS| # tetrads <= 100|

All other situations are blank

## Further classification
Due to the utter dearth of useful information provided by the default classifications, further classifications have been added. These classifications are predominantly to address the fact that, if the National Rarity is blank, it is unknown whether the taxa was assessed, whether it was ruled as having insufficient data for assessment, or whether the taxa has > 100 tetrads.

The full table of classifications used is below.

|Classification|Abbreviation|Criteria|
|---|---|---|
|Nationally Rare|NR| # tetrads <= 15|
|Nationally Scarce|NS| # tetrads <= 100|
|Nationally Frequent|NF| # tetrads > 100|
|Insufficient Data|ID| There is insufficient data to reach a reliable conclusion|
|Extinct|EX|The taxon is considered regionally extinct on the basis of having not been seen for 30 years with targeted survey effort, or for 40 years without targeted survey effort.|

## Movement of taxa without provided justification
Taxa may be moved, without providing written justification, following specific rules. All other movements *must* provide justification for their movement.

### Movement to Insufficient Data
Any taxa may be moved to 'Insufficient Data' from 'Nationally Rare' or 'Nationally Scarce'.
