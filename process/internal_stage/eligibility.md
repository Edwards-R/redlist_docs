# Elegibility Assessment
*See [definition](../../glossary.md#eligibility-assessment) for details*

Not all taxa are eligible for assessment. Each should be assessed for eligibility according to the [eligibility pipeline](../../diagrams/eligibility_pipeline.drawio.svg). The following text details the potential outcomes of the respective eligibility assessments and what the result means. Each section also has a flow chart detailing how the assessment is to be carried out.

## Colonisation status
Taxa tagged with any colonisation status are eligible for inclusion at the taxon expert's decision.

[Flow chart for assessing colonisation status](../../diagrams/eligibility_colonisation.drawio.svg)
|Status|Meaning|
|---|---|
| Post-assessment colonist| This taxon colonised the assessment area after the assessment calculations were performed |
| Peri-assessment colonist | This taxon colonised the assessment area during the assessment 10 year timescale (2011-2022) |

## Vagrancy status
Vagrant taxa are ineligible for assessment

|Status|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Vagrant| The taxon has been identified in the assessment area, but is not considered to have established a breeding population at the point of 2022|

## Synathropic status
Synanthropic taxa are ineligible for assessment

[Flow chart for assessing synanthropy status](../../diagrams/eligibility_synathropy.drawio.svg)
|Status|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Synanthropic| The taxon is considered to have strong synanthropic links which have destabilised or bypassed natural barriers, thus rendering it ineligible for inclusion on the Red List. Simple examples include *Apis mellifera*, which is excluded on the basis of being commercially farmed, and the ant **, which is suspected to have arrived via garden compost.
