# Data Collection
This section provides an overview of the methods by which data were assembled for use in the Red List project.

## Sources of data
The data used for this Red List come from two sources: the UK Bees Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS), and the Essex Field Club. Both of these data sources are considered tertiary data sources as they compile data froma range of primary sources. Furthermore, both sources are considered to be *opportunistic occurrence* datasets.

## Essex Field Club
The Essex Field Club hold data on multiple taxa for the 'Essex' general region. This data is held as a commercial interest of the Essex Field Club and is therefore not openly available. There is a degree of overlap with the BWARS dataset, with some contributors submitting to both schemes, as well as open data being sourced to both schemes.

This dataset consists of 85770 records.

## BWARS
The BWARS dataset covers Great Britain, all of Ireland, as well as the Channel Islands. Again, BWARS data is not open sourced as a significant portion of data is derived from commercial surveys and activities - many of which have financial vested interests.

This dataset consists of 1,116,599 records for Great Britain.

## Collection methodology
There is no standardised collection or survey method for either dataset. Very little recording of most taxa in this Red List is performed. Both datasets therefore focus on collecting as much reliable data as possible, from as many sources as possible, and as such focus on the 'most common data', which consists of

- What
- Where
- When

## Citizen Science
BWARS and Hymettus do not consider the moniker 'Citizen Scientist' to have supportable meaning for aculeate hymenoptera recording. There are so few opportunities for 'professional' work that the majority of contributors to the BWARS dataset would be considered 'non-professionals', despite their considerable knowledge of the taxa. Furthermore, professionals *do* contribute large volumes of data to BWARS, as do academics.

## Examples of collection methods

The following sections illustrate a few known collection 'methodologies' for data in the BWARS dataset.

### Roadside opportunity
A utility worked saw an interesting bee whilst on their lunch break. The bee was collected and identified under a microscope that weekend, and the data added to the BWARS database.

### Academic survey
A student collected data as part of a controlled sampling effort in their PhD. With the assistance of experienced taxonomists, this material was identified to species level, then added to the BWARS database.

### Regular walk
An entomologist regularly walks a local nature reserve and collects species-level data across a wide range of invertebrates. This data is then shared with the nature reserve wardens, BWARS, and the NBN.

## Reasons for non-abundance data
In order to achieve an practical and usable abundance dataset, sampling methodologies must be defined, followed, and quality controlled.
