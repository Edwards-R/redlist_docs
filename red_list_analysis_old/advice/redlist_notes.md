# Definitions

## Isolation definition of subpopulation

 A subpopulation is defined as one which *cannot* be exchanging individuals with other subpopulations (pg 5). In applicable terms for the target taxa, this can be read as 'genetic information'.

## Apis melifera
(pg 6)

>`Domesticated taxa (in the case where a taxon comprises both domesticated and wild individuals, only the wild population may be assessed and included; feral animals derived from a domesticated source should not be included`

## Data deficient
(pg 11)

>`The inclination to assess taxa as Data Deficient may be very strong; it should be emphasized that assessors must use all data available in full when making a Red List assessment. Precise information on scarce taxa is usually lacking, and although the criteria are highly quantitative and defined, one can use projections, assumptions and inferences (as long as they are explicitly stated and clearly justified) to place a taxon in the appropriate category`

Pretty much - avoid using DD wherever possible. This includes the use of models to infer and project.


## Transfer of categories
(pg 11)

Given that it has been so long since that last Red List that they followed entirely different guidance, there is no previous Red List to base assessment on. Any attempt to contrast prior Red List information is also stymied by the fact that previous Red Lists did not use understandings and so would need to have their nomenclature re-evaluated.

As such, **ALL** evaluations will be treated as novel for the region.

## Assessment via multiple criteria
pg 14

Whilst only one criterion need be met, all species should be assessed against all criteria, regardless of whether they all meet the same level.

This will likely be done through a decision-tree for each nomenclatural entry

The result is the most threatened category


## Use of inference, projection
pg 14

>`Although the criteria for each of the categories of threat are based on quantitative thresholds, the system remains relatively flexible to ensure that taxa for which there is very little information can also be assessed. This has been achieved by incorporating inference, suspicion and projection into the assessment process. Therefore, the person conducting an assessment is expected to use the best available information in combination with inference, suspicion and projection to test a taxon against the criteria. However, if inference, suspicion and projection are used, the assumptions made must be documented. If there is any reasonable concern that a taxon is threatened with extinction in the near future, it should qualify for the criteria of one of the categories of threat`

This supports the use of a model *by an expert, using interpretation*.

## Applicability of threat criteria
pg 15

This is done in a separate file

## Identification of specific threat vs identification of result of threat
pg 16

>`A taxon may be classified as threatened even if a threatening process cannot be identified`

## Climate change
pg 16

>`However, different threats, especially new threats or poorly understood processes such as global climate change may require further guidance in the application of definitions and criteria. Section 12 provides guidance specific to different threats.`

This suggests that the criteria may not be sufficient for dealing with climate change

[This document of the EA flood plans](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/920944/023_15482_Environment_agency_digitalAW_Strategy.pdf) may be useful

## Separating decline from fluctuation
pg 17

>`However, different threats, especially new threats or poorly understood processes such as global climate change may require further guidance in the application of definitions and criteria. Section 12 provides guidance specific to different threats.`

This is not necessarily appropriate for inverts who rely on climate cycles whose length and cause have not been fully identified. Previous experience has identified that 10 years is too short to avoid/mitigate climate cycle effects.

## Heathland conservation measures
pg 18

`any conservation measures must be included with the assessment documentation`

Heathland is a conserved habitat, the conservation relying predominantly on government spending which is in an uncertain state.

## Stating threat categories
pg 18

This section gives the information on how a threat category should be stated

## Definition of data 'Quality'
pg 19

Order of importance:

1. Observed
2. Estimated (past) || Projected (future)
3. Inferred
4. Suspected

## Minimum data quality
pg 19

Specific criteria have a minimum permitted quality that may be used

## 'Observed'
pp 19-20

The definition of 'Observed' requires exhaustive census of all known adults or direct observation of all known habitat. This metric is therefore inapplicable to this invertebrate assessment.

## 'Estimated/Projected'
pg 20

Models from BWARS data meet this criteria, though expert opinion does not.

## Risk management/handling
pp 22-24

Risks should be approached with a `precautionary but realistic attitude`. Any decisions taken must be documented. The use of 'Risk & Impact' assessment has been proposed.

## Uncertainty & Risk tolerance
pg 24

Assessors are instructed to `have low risk tolerance`. This goes on to mainly address situations which involve computer confidence intervals. Refer to this section when uncertain between multiple final threat categories.

## Number of mature individuals
pg 26

References to 'Social bees and ants' here considered incorrect and dangerous. Do not attempt this.


## Generation length
pp 29-31

For the purpose of a Red List, generation time is considered 1 year, which means that the analysis will be performed at 10 year intervals rather than generation length.

## Declines through statistical models
pp 32-37

These models are predicated on a known pattern of decline, which is a false statement for the subject matter. As such, these models are not of use as to use them would be to mandate a potentially untrue assumption. Doing so has an extreme risk of resulting in incorrect assessment.

## Population modelling
pg 37

Do not attempt to reach Criterion E (Risk of Extinction) as it is inapplicable for the taxonomic grouping.

Unfortunately, this section *only* deals with models that create a 'Risk of Extinction' rather than models which try to create a model of the population.

This section is therefore deemed inapplicable to the assessment using the population model. A note should be made in the documentation differentiating between the Red List definition of a 'Population Model' and the project definition of a population model.

## Continuing decline
pg 44

>`A continuing decline is a recent, current or projected future decline (which may be smooth, irregular or sporadic) which is liable to continue unless remedial measures are taken. Fluctuations will not normally count as continuing declines, but an observed decline should not be considered as a fluctuation unless there is evidence for this.`

This is a robust metric which can be used for all assessments in this project

>`A continuing decline under criteria B or C can be projected, thus, it does not have to have started yet. However, such projected declines must be justified and there must be high degree of certainty that they will take place (i.e., merely 'plausible' future declines are not allowed)`

This is perhaps part of the answer to risk-based declines. If heathland conservation is defunded then heathland-reliant species will decline. Is there a real-world risk of this happening? That relies on expert advice as, whilst the government's position has been repeatedly stated, very little concrete evidence has emerged.

Similarly with sea level change. The projected decline is justified i.e.

>**Risk**: This species nests in sea-level flats which will be flooded if the sea defences are breached or rise past a given threshold. The species cannot expand its habitat as the adjoining landscape is heavily anthropic and does not feature the requisite components for the species. As the cost of maintaining sea defences (which is noted in the EA report as unfunded) rises, there is lilkely to be increasing pressure to minimises the amount of sea defence maintained.

>**Severity**: Moderate - High
>**Probability**: Moderate

Aside from this, assessing something as a **continuing decline** requires that the reason for decline be identified. This is not the case for the vast majority of the taxa, making this a rather uncertain application. It is suggested that 

## Severely fragmented
pp 48-49

>`The phrase ‘severely fragmented’ refers to the situation in which increased extinction risks to the taxon results from the fact that most of its individuals are found in small and relatively isolated subpopulations (in certain circumstances this may be inferred from habitat information). These small subpopulations may go extinct, with a reduced probability of recolonization.`

>`Fragmentation must be assessed at a scale that is appropriate to biological isolation in the taxon under consideration`

>`The following criterion can be used to decide whether there is severe fragmentation in cases where data are available on (i) the distribution of area of occupancy (i.e., detailed maps of occupied habitat), (ii) some aspect of the dispersal ability of the taxon (e.g., average dispersal distance), and (iii) average population density in occupied habitat (e.g., information on territory size, home range size, etc.), then: A taxon can be considered to be severely fragmented if most (>50%) of its total area of occupancy is in habitat patches that are (1) smaller than would be required to support a viable population, and (2) separated from other habitat patches by a large distance relative to dispersal kernel of the species (see below).`

>`Criterion B is often used in the absence of any information on population size, density or structure. Therefore, for (1), the area for a viable population (or, the interpretation of "small" in the definition of severely fragmented) should be based on rudimentary and generic estimates of population density, and on the ecology of the taxon`

>`For (2), the degree of isolation of patches should be based on dispersal distance of the taxon. For example, subpopulations that are isolated by distances several times greater than the (long-term) average dispersal distance of the taxon may be considered isolated`

>`Note that the existence (or even a large number) of small and isolated patches is not sufficient to consider the taxon severely fragmented. For meeting this criterion, more than half of the individuals (or, more than half of the occupied habitat area) must be in small and isolated patches. On the other hand, a taxon with a single subpopulation can also be severely fragmented, if that subpopulation is too small to be viable (because a single population is by definition isolated). Similarly, a taxon with two subpopulations can be severely fragmented if they are isolated from each other, and both are too small to be viable.`

In summary, a fragment for this assessment is defined as:
* >40 km (average dispersal distance) apart
* 'small' at the discretion of the experts

Following this, >50% of the population must be in 'fragments' chunks



## Location as a factor of threat
pg 49

A location may be defined by threat:

>`A taxon may be severely fragmented, yet all the isolated subpopulations may be threatened by the same major factor (single location), or each subpopulation may be threatened by a different factor (many locations)`

See [location](#location)

## EoO
pp 49-52

>`Extent of occurrence (EOO) is a parameter that measures the spatial spread of the areas currently occupied by the taxon`

This makes sense, but only in a **global** scope. Not really in a *regional* scope of the magnitude of 'Great Britain' as it's simply too small.

>`The intent behind this parameter is to measure the degree to which risks from threatening factors are spread spatially across the taxon’s geographical distribution. The theoretical basis for using EOO as a measure of risk spreading is the observation that many environmental variables and processes are spatially correlated, meaning that locations that are close to each other experience more similar (more correlated) conditions over time than locations that are far away from each other. These processes include both human threats (such as diseases, invasive species, oil spills, non-native predators, habitat loss to development, etc.) and natural processes (fluctuations in environmental variables such as droughts, heat waves, cold snaps, hurricanes and other weather events, as well as other disturbance events such as fires, floods, and volcanism). Higher correlation leads to higher overall extinction risk, so that, all other things being equal, a set of populations spread in a small area have higher extinction risk overall than a set of populations spread over a larger area`

This is an ***incredibly*** problematic statement to apply to Aculeate Hymenoptera. It implies the ability to distinguish 'populations', the ability for said populations to interconnect, and that the assessment is being performed at a scale which makes sense i.e. **greater than** regional.

>`Exclusions are not recommended for criterion B1, because disjunctions and outlying occurrences accurately reflect the extent to which a large range size reduces the chance that the entire population of the taxon will be affected by a single threatening process`

Not true in the taxa we are assessing - this has an implicit assumption that the noted habitat is interconnected by less than the general dispersal distance. It also assumes that the potential for occupation is uniformly applicable across the entire EoO, which is demonstrably false.

>`Therefore, a method such as the -hull (a generalization of a convex hull) is recommended for assessing reductions of continuing declines in EOO because it substantially reduces the biases that may result from the spatial arrangement of habitat`

This makes more sense as it addresses the above issue of the non-uniform applicability of occupation. However, the method used is crude. Buffer-Union addresses the issue in the exact same way as an Alpha-Hull whilst addressing the issue of 'drawing order' in poorly sampled species that was uncovered during testing. It is expected that Buffer-Union will slightly over-estimate compared to Alpha-Hull as it includes area within the radius of the outermost points rather than excluding it (Update: It does, but in an *extremely* uniform manner). This comparative overestimation will be slightly greater on species with lower data volume than those with higher data volume. The bias is considered acceptable in exchange for the vastly greater insight that Buffer-Union grants on sparse data sets, which make up the majority of the assessment taxa.

>`The third step is to delete all lines that are longer than a multiple () of the average line length. (This product of  and the average line length represents a “discontinuity distance”.) The value of  can be chosen with a required level of resolution in mind. The smaller the value of , the finer the resolution of the hull. Experience has shown that an  value of 2 is a good starting point for some species (however, the value to use for specific cases of assessing reductions in EOO should be based on a compromise between minimizing the potential bias associated with incomplete sampling of outlying occurrences and minimizing the departure from a convex hull)`

This is not practical for the assessed taxa due to the potentially extremely low density of some of the data and variation in sampling effort across the three 10-year assessment periods. Practically speaking, the distance can be set to the average expected dispersion distance (40 km in this case). This allows the Buffer-Union to take on the responsibility of filling in gaps rather than the algorithm. The algorithm's responsibility is devolved to an expert-derived appropriate metric of '*What is the maximum area in which I might expect to find this species, given I found one here?*'

### EoO Actually refers to two metrics
This is implied in the documentation but never outright stated, which has lead to a lot of confusion.  The documentation incorrectly uses the term 'EoO' in multiple places without defining which variants of EoO are permissible.

### EoO as MCP
This version is to be used to calculate the EoO for use in B1. The documentation states:
>`for assessments of criterion B1, exclusion of areas forming discontinuities or disjunctions from estimates of EOO is strongly discouraged. Exclusions are not recommended for criterion B1, because disjunctions and outlying occurrences accurately reflect the extent to which a large range size reduces the chance that the entire population of the taxon will be affected by a single threatening process`

This means that B1 is designed to be an indicator of the probability that a single threat will impact the entire population, or at least enough to make a significant impact. This is, once again, a highly specialised test, the greatest relevance to the taxa here being climate change. The metric as calculated by MCP can only be significantly affected by complete loss of the species in a cardinal direction, if even then. Therefore the impact must affect the taxon based on a specific cardinal direction in order for it to be detected by this metric.

Specifically, this metric cannot address any level of fragmentation, separation, or internal degredation relating to the subject taxon. As such, its usefulness is highly limited for the purpose of this particular assessment as climate change scenarios fall under 'predicted' rather than 'observed' events.

Also highly relevant is that this metric is vulnerable to extreme changes in result based on minor changes in occurrence, as a result of the incomplete monitoring effort on behalf of most taxa. Expert opinion should be used in such cases to override any results from EoO with the justification that there is insufficient data to use the MCP.

### EoO as Buffer-Union (or Alpha-hull)
This version of EoO can contain 'discontinuities or disjunctions'. The plain translation being 'not every polygon needs to be attached to all others, and holes in the polygon are ok'. As such, this version of EoO functions as a more permissive interpretation of the raw occurrence values used by AoO. Compared to [[Red List Guidance Notes#EoO as MCP|EoO as MCP]], EoO metrics formed via methods such as Buffer-Union or Alpha-hull can be considered as modelling the *potential area of occurrence*. Such an approach is highly useful when dealing with taxa where recording is incomplete - the majority of taxa in the world.

This version of EoO may not be used by B1, but *may* be used by B2. This was clearly stated by Caroline Pollock:
>`So, for calculating the current EOO to compare against the criterion B1 thresholds, you should be using a single minimum convex polygon that encompasses ALL the known, inferred or projected sites of present occurrence of the taxon. However, for the purpose of identifying when the EOO is undergoing continuing decline (e.g., for criterion B subcriterion b(i)), or to highlight a potential reduction in population size because the EOO has decreased between two points in time (e.g., for criterion A), the rough scale of the minimum convex polygon is less suitable. This is why the guidelines recommend using the alpha hull approach to assess continuing declines or reductions. Note that for this purpose, you are answering the question “is there continuing decline in EOO” with “yes” or “no”, so you are not actually presenting two different estimates for EOO.`

Note that 'EoO' is used interchangably in this exchange between MCP and Buffer-Union/Alpha-hull derived variants.

### Definition of variants of EoO
The ability to state 'EoO' and have two potential meanings is a flaw in the documentation, as terms are not clearly defined. Accordingly, terms must be found to establish intent. Following the intent of the use of MCP as not containing disjunctions or discontinuities, the version of EoO calculated in this way will be called the **Continuous EoO**, abbreviated to **CEoO**. The alternative, calculated in such ways as Buffer-Union or Alpha-hull, will be called the **Disjunct EoO**, abbreviated to **DEoO**.

## AoO

pp 52-61

>`Area of occupancy (AOO) is a scaled metric that represents the area of suitable habitat currently occupied by the taxon`

>`To ensure valid use of the criteria and maintain consistency of Red List assessments across taxa it is essential to scale estimates of AOO using 2 x 2 km grid cells`

AoO is therefore only computable using <=1,000 m accuracy data at 2,000 m resolution, and only by direct cell counts. Otherwise I'd go to the Buffer-Union as a metric, but that is being used as EoO.

> `AOO = no. occupied cells x area of an individual cell (equation 4.1)`

This is where I'd go. We can calculate it easily and it is the suggested equation. The rest of this section seems to be very much a 'what to do if you can't do this'.

>`Linear habitat`

At a 2 km resolution, roughly the foraging distance of most of the winged taxa, there is little concern over linear habitat species.

>`Both AOO and EOO may be estimated based on “…known, inferred or projected sites of present occurrences…”`

EoO is already being inferred by the best method we know of. Do not attempt to do the same with AoO as that will reduce the accuracy of the assessment rather than improve it.

>`Inevitably, a taxon may not have been detected everywhere that it occurs, either because it has cryptic life forms, short-lived detectable life stages, is hard to identify (and few capable experts available), or because it occurs in inaccessible or poorly surveyed regions.`

These all apply to the target taxa

>`Underestimation of AOO will affect the outcome of Red List assessments under criterion B2, e.g. if the estimated AOO is less than, or close to, 2,000 km2 , the lower threshold of the VU category. In such cases, assessors may not be able to justify the assumption that AOO is estimated accurately from a simple intersection of current records with a standard 2 x 2 km grid, and an alternative assumption must be made in support of a more accurate estimate.`

This means that expert opinion may be used to supersede in the case of data deficiency.

## Location

>`The term ‘location’ defines a geographically or ecologically distinct area in which a single threatening event can rapidly affect all individuals of the taxon present. The size of the location depends on the area covered by the threatening event and may include part of one or many subpopulations. Where a taxon is affected by more than one threatening event, location should be defined by considering the most serious plausible threat. (IUCN 2001, 2012b)`

This has changed since the last Red List guidance so that a 'location' is now *primarily* defined by threat rather than *alternatively* defined by threat.

>`When there are several threats, locations should be based on the one that has the maximum product of probability and consequence (in terms of percentage reduction in population)`

The 'location' section for some reason does not operate at the 10 year/3 generation scale but at 3 year/1 generation, whichever is longer.  This scales makes minimal sense for invertebrates and is suggested to be reverted to the 10 year scale which the rest of the assessment is based on, on the basis that there simply is not the volume of data required to make predictions at a three-year resolution.

Also notably absent is any form of long-term threat definition for a location. For example, the 'south coast' is at a *long-term* threat of increasing sea levels with an almost *certain* level of confidence in that threat taking place. However, there is no provision for defining 'the south coast' as a singular location based on this threat. The argument for doing so is that it is far *far* better to plan ahead of time for mitigation works than to reach the point where the species is *already* decling before addressing threats.

# Guidelines for Applying Criteria

## Criterion A
Any reference to EoO under A refers to Disjunct EoO, which will be supplied by Buffer-Union.

### A1
Inapplicable due to a requirement to understand the reason for a reduction.

>`If any of the three conditions (reversible and understood and ceased) are not met in a substantial portion of the taxon's population (10% or more), then A2 should be used instead of A1`

### A2
Usable at 80%, 50%, 30%

Imperative here is the idea that the record numbers are
>`An index of abundance appropriate to the taxon`

### A3
Possibly usable for future predictions relating to heathland threat and other climate threats, see [[Red List Guidelines.pdf#page=96|pg 96]] of the Red List Guidance

>`Criteria A3 and A4 may be applied if a population reduction of a given magnitude may be inferred from relevant evidence`

### A4
Same restrictions as A3 in that to use A4 one must include population changes in the future, which is not modeled as part of this assessment. Debatable whether A3 or A4 should be used for predictions.

### a) Direct observation
Not suitable
>`(all counted - census)`

### b) Index of abundance appropriate to the taxon
This is one option for where the model should be assessed

### c) Area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and/or quality of habitat
There is no population-related metric that directly correlates to area.

### d) Actual or potential levels of exploitation
Not appropriate

### e) The effects of introduced taxa, hybridization, pathogens, pollutants, competitors, or parasites.
Not appropriate

## Criterion B

>`Criterion B has been designed to identify populations with restricted distributions that are also severely fragmented or have few locations, undergoing a form of continuing decline, and/or exhibiting extreme fluctuations (in the present or near future)`

Guidance on the use of **B** is very scarce. This is made harder by the fact that documentation refers to two different variations of EoO without discriminating between them (see [[Red List Guidance Notes#EoO Actually refers to two metrics|EoO refers to two metrics]]). 

### B1
The version of EoO referenced here is Continuous EoO, calculated by MCP. Expert advise is that this metric does not provide any valuable insight into threats to the assessed taxa. 

### B2
AOO use supportable here. Note that the EoO metric used for B2 refers to Disjunct EoO and will be supplied by Buffer-Union

>`To qualify for criterion B, the general distributional threshold must first be met for one of the categories of threat, either in terms of extent of occurrence (EOO) or area of occupancy (AOO)`

>`The taxon must then meet at least TWO of the three options`

This is now an extremely difficult to use criteria as it must include **two** of the following **three** options, of which **two** are inapplicable without prior modification and justification.

### a)
Severely fragmented or known to exist in no more than x [[Red List Guidance Notes#Location|Locations]]

### b)
[[Red List Guidance Notes#Continuing decline|Continuing Decline]]
(in AoO or EoO, whichever was used)

### c)
Extreme fluctuation (**Inapplicable**)

## Criterion C

This criterion is unusable as it requires the population to `be estimated to number less than 2,500 mature individuals`.

No metric available measures the number of mature individuals, and that number of 'mature individuals' is vastly inapplicable to the taxon group as a measure of threat.

## Criterion D

### D

Inapplicable for the same reasons as [[Red List Guidance Notes#Criterion C|Criterion C]]

### D2

>`The focus of subcriterion D2 is not the area or the location count (for which many taxa could qualify), but the risk that the taxon could suddenly become Critically Endangered or Extinct (i.e., if the plausible threat is realized, then the species will within a very short time qualify for listing in one of these categories under, for example, criterion A or B)`

Why does this miss EN?

Very difficult to make applicable given the 'expanded' definition of the category. This seems very much like an 'add-on' and one of the weaker parts of the Red List process. This is especially true for the project taxon group, though that could be said for a lot of the Red List process.

>`Taxa that have very restricted distributions and become susceptible under climate change to a threat that is plausible and liable to cause the entire population to rapidly become Critically Endangered or even Extinct in the Wild will be eligible for listing as Vulnerable under criterion D2. However, classification under criterion D2 is only permissible if the effects of climate change Red List Guidelines 93 are such that the taxon is capable of becoming Critically Endangered or Extinct in a very short time period after the effects of the threat become apparent.`

This seems to be pushing away from D2 and more into A3 & A4

## Criterion E

Not applicable. No models assess the potential of extinction.

# Guidelines for categories

## Data Deficient
[[Red List Guidelines.pdf#page=80|pg 80]]

Taxonomic uncertainty should be used as a supporting argument for DD where applicable


# Guidelines for Threatening Processes

## Global climate change

The example given is an amphibian, which still has a far longer lifespan than the taxa in this study. This section of the documentation addresses the exact same issues that I have independently identified as critical flaws in the Red List process.

>`Therefore, there is a need to develop further guidance for using the IUCN Red List system, especially in data-poor situations and for timely policy responses to exploit the maximum warning time available for species on extinction trajectories in response to changes in climate`

This phrase provides justification for modifications to the threat assessment period

>`The time horizons used in the criteria serve several purposes. First, the generation time is used as a surrogate for turnover rates within populations and as a biologically relevant scaling factor that corrects for the variation in rates at which different taxa survive and reproduce. Second, the time horizon is set to a minimum of 10 years because measuring changes over shorter time periods is difficult and does not reflect time scales for human interventions. Third, the time horizon is set to a maximum of 100 years into the future, because of the uncertainties in predicting population sizes for a long time from the present day (Mace et al. 2008).`

Under this, threats that are up to 100 years away may be included in assessment. It is suggested that these threats should be moderate confidence and above, and moderate impact and above, both under a risk analysis matrix.

>`for many species, especially short-lived ones, Red List assessments are based on time horizons much shorter than the long periods over which we now expect the world's climate and its effect on species will change`

This is absolutely the case for this project.

>`In addition, some amount of climate change-related impact is irreversible (already committed) because of the lag between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (and subsequent biological change)`

Also applicable

[[Red List Guidelines.pdf#page=91|pg 91]] provides specific support for the use of A3 & A4 for the use of long-term predictions. It has rather unrealistic ideas of exactly how much effort can be spent per-species though!!

# The use of models

>`Studies have shown that projections from alternative models can be so variable as to compromise assessment of whether species potential distributions should contract or expand for any given climate scenario`

>`We suggest that at least three modelling techniques should be compared and be as independent as possible with regards to how they link the response and the predictor variables`

## Interpretation of AoO in poor sampling conditions
If there's low sampling volume, we can use inferrence by expert opinion as per 3.2 to back anything up
