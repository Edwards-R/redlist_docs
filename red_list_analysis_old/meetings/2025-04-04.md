# Questions
- No B. subt narrative from Ben. Is this just an oversight or a data handling problem?
- Need to do trim() on narratives to remove leading spaces
- Word's stupid hyphenation is present. Check Markdown output to see if it causes errors
    - It probably causes errors. The two versions of hyphens are being used ~~intelligently~~ automatically by Word.
    - Search & replace them, check for need for `\-` first
- Chrysis pseudobrevitarsis - can't talk about the 'previous species' like that. Need to give a name, people can sort and change orders! **Fixed**
- There's some odd `\` appearing. I suspect Word ~~intelligence~~ stupidity with special characters. Check Eucera nigrescens
- Plastanoxus chittendenii: iso. Perkins: 1976  - Could move this to NA, but that's a call on something from that long ago. What does Perkins say about it? **Perkins says nothing about involvement with synanthropy**
- Archnospila rufa has no entry
- 
- Add last record date to RE taxa
- List of taxa without eco narratives
- RE to take on the stats narratives
- RE to build website
