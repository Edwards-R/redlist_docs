# Wider Context
A core idea behind the creation of a regional Red List is to place the regional result into the wider context of a global Red List. Unfortunately, there does not exist a global Red List for this assessment's taxa. The closest that exists to such a work is the [2019 European Red List of Bees](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-4-019.pdf). There are a number of important factors to consider before attempting to use the European Red List as a point of comparison:

- The European Red List resulted in a high proportion of `Data Deficient` results, due to problems in establishing a unified taxonomic backbone across multiple regions. Many European regions have their own regional interpretations of taxonomy, without a means to exchange data between them. Whilst the use of [understandings](../../glossary.md#nomenclatural-understanding) removes this problem from this project, the European Red List would need resolving to understandings before it can be matched, where even possible, to this assessment's taxa.

- There have been many taxonomic and nomenclatural changes between the point where the European Red List was created and now. Ensuring accuracy between current GB understandings and the European Red List understandings requires careful attention from a number of highly knowledgeable experts.
