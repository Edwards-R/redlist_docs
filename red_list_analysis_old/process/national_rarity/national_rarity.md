# National Rarity Assessment Process

Rarity statuses will be automatically calculated based on the [criteria](../../regional_rarity.md).

The [internal review team](../../glossary.md#internal-review-team) will then review each status. The options are to accept the calculated value or to change to a different result. If a change is made, justification must be given.
