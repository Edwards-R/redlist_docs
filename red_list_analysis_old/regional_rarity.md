# Regional Rarity
Assessment of regional rarity is not part of the UICN Red List process. It has been added into this assessment upon the request of Natural England.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Regional Rarity assessment is to establish how *rare* something is. This is a deliberate distinction from the IUCN Red List, which assess how *threatened* something is. Most importantly, the Red List being carried out is a *regional* Red List. It is perfectly valid to have a taxon which is rare in the assessment area yet not threatened due to the presence of a large population outside of the assessment area.

## Method
The number of unique hectads, per taxon, within the assessment period of 1992-2021 inclusive, was counted.

## Classifications

|Classification|Meaning|Criteria|
|---|---|---|
| NR | Nationally Rare | *N* <= 15 hectads |
| NS | Nationally Scarce | 15 < *N* <= 100 hectads |
| NF | Nationally Frequent | *N* > 200 hectads |
| ID | Insufficient Data | Experts do not consider there to be enough data to classify the taxon |
