## Assessing Near Threatened
Near threatened (NT) may be used where a taxon does not meet the threshold for inclusion under vulnerable (VU), but an expert deems it appropriate to flag the taxon as potentially in significant decline. The exact reasons for this are not strictly defined, as the status is deliberately placed as a 'catch-all' for situations where an expert has concerns. Typical uses for NT are:

- A taxon is not exhibiting quantified signs of decline, yet field experts believe there to be substantial decline. The result is considered a *suspected* decline, which according to the rulings may be given a status of NT
- A taxon has declined, but not in a strictly significant quantifiable manner. Where a taxon slightly misses the Red List quantifiable target for achieving a status of VU, NT may be considered as an alternative.

## Data Deficient (DD)
Every effort has been made to avoid ranking a taxon as DD whilst maintaining a strictly evidentiary approach. The majority of DD taxa are:
- those with modern nomenclatural or taxonomic confusion rendering data unusable
- taxa which are so rare that there does not exist enough information to make an informed statement on their status

Where insufficient data exist to reach a quantified conclusion, expert opinion is assessed to attempt to reach a non-quantified conclusion. Doing so results in far fewer taxa reaching DD status.

## Extinctions
A taxon may be declared regionally extinct if it has not been seen for 30 years with targeted survey effort, or for 40 years without targeted survey effort. This range of values comes from previous studies to find purportedly extinct taxa, as well as evidence in the BWARS dataset on scarcely recorded taxa. The values are designed to deliver reasonable certainty of extinction when factoring in taxa with extreme identification or sampling protocol difficulty.

## Regional Rarity
Regional rarity assesses a taxon based on how many unique tetrads are occupied. The statuses which can be assigned as:

|Classification|Meaning|Criteria|
|---|---|---|
| NR | Nationally Rare | *N* <= 15 hectads |
| NS | Nationally Scarce | 15 < *N* <= 100 hectads |
| NF | Nationally Frequent | *N* > 200 hectads |
| ID | Insufficient Data | Experts do not consider there to be enough data to classify the taxon |

The inclusion of `NF` and `ID` remove the possibility for a taxon to have the same status - blank - for two entirely different reasons.
