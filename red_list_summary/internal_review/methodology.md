## Methodology
The fundamental protocol of this Red List is to utilise multiple models, statistical and otherwise, to evaluate each taxon against Red List Criteria. The models used are:

- Expert opinion
- Raw record count
- Tetrad area
- Minimum Convex Polygon
- 40 km buffered polygon (Buffer-Union)
- Frescalo (Taxon association mitigation)
- Bayesian Occupancy (Bayesian frequency interpretation)
