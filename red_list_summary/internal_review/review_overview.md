## Internal Review Overview
The Internal Review is the first point where a taxon is assessed for a threat status. Three people are presented with a spread of information regarding each taxon and must assess the taxon accordingly. This Red List is one of the first attempts to utilise more complex statistical models in entomological datasets, as well as utilising a composite approach to assessment using said models. Accordingly, the section below provides an overview of why this approach was taken.

### The use of models in the Red List
There is no standardised recording or monitoring protocol in place for the vast majority of taxa covered by this Red List. Instead, the vast majority of data collected for the taxon group is opportunistic. The difficulty is then in extracting reliable trend information from this opportunistic dataset, which can then be assessed according to the Red List **guidance**.

The method chosen to perform this process for this Red List assessment is to use multiple models to assess each taxon. These models range from simple record counts, to spatial models, occupancy models, and expert opinion. If multiple models all indicate the same general trend, confidence in that trend increases. If models highly vary, the three experts are asked to posit reasons for this discrepancy. The most common reason for highly varied models is simply the data volume being too low for the more complex models to complete with confidence.

All models are liable to errors. The more complex models in this assessment, Frescalo and Bayesian Occupancy, are especially reliant on the input data falling with certain, not entirely understood, parameters. When these parameters are not fulfilled, the models can diverge strongly from expected parameters. The majority of such divergences will be noticed for the first time when a model significantly deviates from the expectations of the taxon field experts. In such situations, it is the role of the taxon data expert to interrogate the models and raw data in greater detail. The findings are then to be explained to the taxon field experts. All three will then rule as to whether a model is within believable parameters. If the model is found to not be reporting believable parameters, said model is excluded from consideration when assessing the status of that taxon.

### Why use models if they are not trustworthy
>*All models are wrong but some models are useful* - George Box

The principle reason to use statistical models for a Red List is driven by the desire of the Red List assessment categories to utilise numerical values for change. Asking an expert to rule on whether has something decline by 'between 30% and 50%' will tend to get you a very blank look, as the expert tries to work out what those percentages would represent in their experience. Experts tend to be very good at telling you whether something has declined or not, and far less able to attach quantified, numerical amounts to the direction. By utilising multiple models with different assumptions and methods, a greater chance at forming an accurate view of a taxon's conservation trend is achieved.

## Wider review
A group of experienced field entomologists, all with significant experience working with the assessment taxa, are asked to review the output of the Internal Review. The responses from this are fed back to the internal team, who then review the responses against the Red List criteria. Any eligible changes are then debated and necessary adjustments made.

## Release
The reviewed Red List is then released for consumption. The idea is that the review is not final, but forms part of a rolling review which taxon-specific projects may feed into.
