## Process Overview
This document outlines the general process by which this Red List is produced. Red List assessments performed in this project progress through distinct phases. These phases and their purposes are outlined, in order, below.

### Data collection
Selection and sourcing of available data to be used in the analysis stage. Specifically, data has been sourced from the UK Bees Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS) and the Essex Field Club. These are both organisations which place a high emphasis on the quality of data generated as opposed to simply assembling the largest possible volume of data.

Any overlap in records between the two data sets was removed prior to calculations.

### Internal Assessment
The initial assessment of taxa, determining eligibility and threat status as per the **Guidance**, with additional project-specific rulings documented as required by the **Guidance**.

The internal assessment is conducted by the internal review team, consisting of two experienced taxon field experts and one experienced taxon data expert.

### Wider Review
Initial assessments are sent out to a select team of experts, covering regional and/or taxon specific expertise. These experts are asked to provide feedback on the Internal Assessment statuses.

### Review Incorporation
Feedback from the Wider Review is examined and assessed for inclusion under the **Guidance** and established rulings. If feedback from the Wider Review is deemed applicable, a status may be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.

### Final Review
Results from the Review Incorporation step presented to the Red List steering group. Any modifications suggested are reviewed against the **Guidance** and established rulings. Successfully evaluated modifications may lead to status adjustment.

### Release
The Red List is released to the wider public.
