## Sources of data
The data used for this Red List come from two sources: the UK Bees Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS), and the Essex Field Club. Both of these data sources are considered tertiary data sources as they compile data from a range of primary sources. Furthermore, both sources are considered to be *opportunistic occurrence* datasets.

### Essex Field Club
The Essex Field Club hold data on multiple taxa for the 'Essex' general region. This data is held as a commercial interest of the Essex Field Club and is therefore not openly available. There is a degree of overlap with the BWARS dataset, with some contributors submitting to both schemes, as well as open data being sourced to both schemes.

This dataset consists of 85,770 records with an unknown degree of overlap with the BWARS dataset.

### BWARS
The BWARS dataset covers Great Britain, all of Ireland, as well as the Channel Islands.BWARS data is not open sourced and instead relies on a crowd-sourcing license. A significant portion of data is derived from commercial surveys and activities - many of which have financial vested interests. The use of a crowd sourcing license allows BWARS freedom to accept data which cannot be released under open access restrictions.

The BWARS dataset consists of 1,116,599 unique records for Great Britain.

## De-duplication
The combined data set was filtered for duplication on the basis of a match of what, where, and when. No finer-grain de-duplication was attempted due to the size of the combined datasets against the probable impact of doing so. Taxa at such low data volume that the duplication of individual records would matter will be marked as Data Deficient against statistical models that rely on this metric.

## Collection methodology
There is no standardised collection or survey method present in either dataset. Very little structured recording of the vast majority of the taxa in this Red List is performed, especially at a level representative of 'Great Britain'. Both datasets therefore focus on collecting as much reliable data as possible, from as many sources as possible, and as such focus on the 'most common data', which consists of:

- What
- Where
- When

## Citizen Science
BWARS and Hymettus do not consider the moniker 'Citizen Scientist' to have supportable meaning for aculeate hymenoptera recording. There are so few opportunities for 'professional' work that the majority of contributors to the BWARS dataset would be considered 'non-professionals', despite their considerable knowledge of the taxa. Furthermore, professionals *do* contribute large volumes of data to BWARS, as do academics.

## Examples of collection methods

The following sections illustrate a few known collection 'methodologies' for data in the BWARS dataset.

### Roadside opportunity
A utility worked saw an interesting bee whilst on their lunch break. The bee was collected and identified under a microscope that weekend, and the data added to the BWARS database.

### Academic survey
A student collected data as part of a controlled sampling effort in their PhD. With the assistance of experienced taxonomists, this material was identified to species level, then added to the BWARS database.

### Regular walk
An entomologist regularly walks a local nature reserve and collects species-level data across a wide range of invertebrates. This data is then shared with the nature reserve wardens, BWARS, and the NBN.

## Reasons for non-abundance data
In order to achieve an practical and usable abundance dataset, sampling methodologies must be defined, followed, and quality controlled. If one wishes to know how many of a thing there are, one must also know the detectability of the item in question, the detection capability of the sensory equipment (in this case, the recorder), the time spent searching, how targetted the search effort was etc. Aculeate hymenoptera are typically a low-frequency encounter, with the searcher's skill *drastically* affecting the probability of observation.

Given then none of this data is collected, in same cases even collectable, there is no known nor accepted way to translate occurrence data into abundance.
