# Ruling
This document contains each ruling passed, with any supporting evidence.

## Support of Rulings
NE considers the process of the Red List to be defined by the document `Guidelines for using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria v15.1`. Every ruling possible should be supported by reference to this document, or by reference to a specific decision. Any deviation from the Red List documentation must be clearly marked and provide reasoning for this decision.

## Use of Nomenclatural Understandings
The assessment will attach a Nomenclatural Understanding to each assessed species in order to anchor them to their particular interpretation at the time of assessment. These understandings are provided by the Bees Wasps & Ants Recording Society (BWARS). A copy of the which can be retreived from the BWARS website or, if modern nomenclature is imperative, upon request to BWARS.
