# Ruling
This document contains each ruling passed, with any supporting evidence.

## Support of Rulings
NE considers the process of the Red List to be defined by the document `Guidelines for using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria v15.1`. Every ruling possible should be supported by reference to this document, or by reference to a specific decision. Any deviation from the Red List documentation must be clearly marked and provide reasoning for this decision.

```
2023-12-07 Meeting with Richard Smith
```

## Regional Guidance

Since this is a regional assesment, the document `Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List criteria at regional and national levels v4.0` must also be considered. However, this document is many years older than the current **Guidance** document.

```
G 2.1.2
To do this it is important to refer to guidelines prepared by the IUCN SSC Regional Applications Working Group (e.g., Gärdenfors et al. 2001; IUCN 2003, 2012a; Miller et al. 2007).
```

## Taxonomic level of assessment
This assessment will take place at **species** level. This is the level at which the most available data resides. There is insufficient information to go below this taxonomic rank at a uniform manner.
```
G 2.1.1
The criteria may be applied to any taxonomic unit at or below the species level
```

## Use of Nomenclatural Understandings
The assessment will attach a Nomenclatural Understanding to each assessed species in order to anchor them to their particular interpretation at the time of assessment. These understandings are provided by the Bees Wasps & Ants Recording Society (BWARS). A copy of the which can be retreived from the BWARS website or, if modern nomenclature is imperative, upon request to BWARS.

This ruling satisfies the requirement from the **Regional Guidance** documentation to document the taxonomic standard followed.

```
r V.2
The introductory sections should include a list of the taxonomic groups that have been evaluated against the Red List Criteria as well as what taxonomic standards have been followed. Any regionally determined settings, filters, etc. should also be clearly reported.
```

## Newly described & undescribed taxa
No taxon which is not tracked by BWARS's Understandings system will be considered, as the Understandings system is a pre-requisite to the utilisation of data. Should the BWARS Understandings be found to be missing any taxa, that taxa will be added to the BWARS system, whereupon it will become eligible for use.

This must happen in order to satisfy the ruling on [taxonomic standards](./rulings.md#use-of-nomenclatural-understandings)

## Apis mellifera
It is considered impossible to separate any 'naturalised' colonies of *Apis mellifera* from commercially farmed stock. As such, *Apis mellifera* is considered inelligible for inclusion in this assessment.

```
G 2.1.4
Domesticated taxa (in the case where a taxon comprises both domesticated and wild individuals, only the wild population may be assessed and included; feral animals derived from a domesticated source should not be included)
```

## Transfer between categories
There are no previous Red List assessments carried out under comparable guidelines to the **Guidance** documentation. As such, all changes are considered to be *Nongenuine changes* by default. There are also numerous changes as a result of changes to taxonomy and new information. Expert advice is that it would be considered dangerous to the end user to attempt to conflate previous Red Lists with this assessment due to the volume of changes in taxonomy, nomenclature, data volume, sampling methodology, and sampling effort.

```
G 2.2.1

Nongenuine change:

Criteria revision: The change in category is the result of the revision of the IUCN Red List Criteria (e.g., 1994 v. 2001 versions). These largely relate to criteria A2, A3, A4, D2 and the removal of the 'Conservation Dependent' category.

New information: The change in category is the result of better knowledge about the taxon, e.g. owing to new or newly synthesized information about the status of the taxon (e.g., better estimates for population size, range size or rate of decline).

Taxonomy: The new category is different from the previous owing to a taxonomic change adopted during the period since the previous assessment. Such changes include: newly split (e.g., the taxon is newly elevated to species level), newly lumped (the taxon is recognized following lumping of two previously recognized taxa), and no longer valid/recognized (either the taxon is no longer valid e.g. because it is now considered to be a hybrid or variant, form or subspecies of another species, or the previously recognized taxon differs from a currently recognized one as a result of a split or lump).
```

## Documentation of assessment
Each model may be assessed against multiple criteria. These assessments should be documented and retained with the assessment, unmodified, so that a reader might understand the exact decision process. This takes the place of writing out the individual results in a 'rationale' field, which is necessary due to the number of assessments made per taxon.

```
G 2.5
All assessments should be documented. Threatened classifications should state the criteria and subcriteria that are met
...
If more than one criterion or subcriterion is met for the highest threat category, then each should be listed. Criteria meeting lower categories of threat should also be documented in the assessment Rationale
```

```
G 3.2.5

The level of uncertainty associated with a particular taxon’s assessment is not apparent from the listing itself, potentially complicating and de-valuing interpretation of listings. When a plausible range for each quantity is used to evaluate the criteria, a range of categories may be obtained, reflecting the uncertainties in the data. However, only a single category, based on a specific attitude to uncertainty, will be listed along with the relevant criteria on the IUCN Red List. It is important to note that the range of possible categories should also be indicated, along with the assessors’ attitudes to uncertainty, in the documentation accompanying the assessment.
```

## Data quality levels

### Observed
This criterion is ineligible for use in this assessment as it requires exact census data, which is not present for any assessed taxa.

```
G 3.1
- Population size based on a census of all known mature individuals of the taxon. 
- Population reduction derived from a census of all known mature individuals that took place three generations ago, and a current census of all known mature individuals.
- Continuing decline in the area, extent or quality of habitat derived from a survey of all known habitat, or from aerial photography of all known habitat.
- Continuing decline in the number of mature individuals derived from multiple censuses of all known mature individuals.
```


### Estimated
This criterion may only be applied to statistical models. Expert opinion is explicitly excluded from this criterion and placed in `Inferred`.

```
G 3.1
 *See section on 'Estimated'*
 ...
 The main difference between Estimated (or Projected) and Inferred is that Inferred values rely on more assumptions than estimated values
```

### Inferred
This criterion may be used by expert opinion. The closest analogy to the way that most data for the assessment taxa is obtained is from 'catch statistics'.

```
G 3.1
Examples include population reduction (A2d) inferred from a change in catch statistics
...
The main difference between Estimated (or Projected) and Inferred is that Inferred values rely on more assumptions than estimated values. For example, inferring reduction from catch statistics not only requires statistical assumptions (e.g., random sampling) and biological assumptions (about the relationship of the harvested section of the population to the total population), but also assumptions about trends in effort, efficiency, and spatial and temporal distribution of the harvest in relation to the population
```

### Ranking estimated vs inferred models
The low data volume available for the majority of taxa is deemed problematic enough that the rank of `Estimated` has been reduced to be equivalent to `Inferred`. Statistical methods lacking data are not robust enough to be considered superior to expert opinion. Instead, statistical methods and expert opinion should be considered to be supporting or opposing one another on the same confidence level.

```
2023-12-07 Meeting with Richard Smith
```

### Suspected
In such an information-poor environment, a suspicion of decline should not be relied upon for a `Threat Status` assessment. Any assessment based on a suspicion is highly liable to be the result of poor data collection or availability. As such, no assessment may use `Suspected` for the basis of any `Threat Status`, leaving only `Near Threatened` or `Least Concern` as options for results.

## Interpration of models
A model is close to useless and highly dangerous without interpretation by an appropriate subject expert. All models, which includes expert opinion by the core and wider review teams, is to be considered a model and subjected to interpretation. This interpretation will be performed predominantly by the core team, in which there is a dedicated member for this task of moderation and interpretation. Following the interpretation by the core team, all interpretations are to be presented to the Red List Steering Group during final review.

## Threat implications
Threat implications will be considered under a two-axis model of *probability* against *impact*. This model involves first of all assessing whether a risk has high, medium, or low probability of occurring within the appropriate time frame. Secondly, the the risk should be assessed as to whether the impact, should the risk materialise, be high, medium, or low.

## Precautionary vs Evidentiary risk attitude
An evidentiary attitude will be used for this assessment, as the lack of data for many taxa would otherwise result in a number of probably spurious assesments.

This was accepted by Richard Smith on 2023-03-17

```
G 3.2.3

Second, assessors need to consider whether they have a precautionary or evidentiary attitude to risk (known as risk tolerance). A precautionary attitude (i.e., low risk tolerance) will classify a taxon as threatened unless it is highly likely that it is not threatened, whereas an evidentiary attitude will classify a taxon as threatened only when there is strong evidence to support a threatened classification
```

## Inter-taxon lifecycle dependency
There is a specific lack of 'completeness' when it comes to inter-taxon relationships for the assessment taxa. As such, the requirement for 'total' reliance in order to use threats to lifecycle-related taxa has been relaxed to the following:

`A taxon may be considered dependent on another if the expert opinion is that the other taxon constitutes the majority of a dependency`

For example, taxon A parasitises taxon X at 80% rate, taxon Y at 10% rate, and taxon Z at 10% rate. If taxon X is assessed to be `Vulnerable`, taxon A may also be assessed as `Vulnerable`, even without the data to demonstrate that assessment, at the discretion of the subject expert.

This assessment should be considered to be `Expert Opinion` at a level of `Inferred`.

```
G 4.1

In the case of taxa obligately dependent on other taxa for all or part of their life cycles, biologically appropriate values for the host taxon should be used
```

## Mature individuals
Data is not given at any supportable level to distinguish between males, non-reproductive females, and reproductive females. As such, all records are considered to be of `mature individuals`. There are also taxa where only one caste is identifiable to species, where upon the desire to avoid a result of `Data Deficient` causes an exception to be made by default. It is considered highly unlikely that this ruling will cause damage to the integrity of the assessment, especially since no direct count information is being utilised.

```
G 4.3

The number of mature individuals is the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction
```

## Generational Length
A value of 1 year has been selected for the generational length of all assessed taxa under the Red List model's options. This value does not impact obligate multi-brood taxa negatively, since the generational length is longer than the 'true' generational length of obligate multi-brooded taxa. The value of 'generational length' will only be used to calculate the length of assessed time.


```
G 4.4

Generation
```

## Exponential Decline
It cannot be assumed that rates of decline are due to constant factors. The identification of ~20 year climate cycle within obtained data specifically precludes the assumption that any declines (or increases) are due to a constant and continuous factor

```
G 4.5.1

Exponential decline can be assumed in cases where the proportional rate of decline of the population is believed to be constant.
```

## Extent of Occurrence (EoO)
Extent of occurrence is conflated within the **Guidance**, resulting in Extent of Occurrence referring to two different metrics. Specifically, G 4.9 paragraph 7, starting `Extent of occurrence can often be measured by a minimum convex polygon...`. Deconstructing section G 4.9 reveals two distinct interpretations and uses for 'Extent of Occurence':

### Continuous Extent of Occurrence
- A singular polygon with no holes which covers the entire known extent of the taxon
- Typified by the use of Minimum Convex Hull
- Only variant of Extent of Occurrence permitted for use in criterion B1
- Intended to assess communicability of risk
- Has numerous assumptions about the assessed population that not all taxa qualify for
- Guiding principle: `a set of populations spread in a small area have higher extinction risk overall than a set of populations spread over a larger area`
- *Not* intended for assessment of range, occupied/potentially occupied habitat

### Discrete Extent of Occurence
- Consists of *N* polygons
- Holes permitted
- Typified by Alpha Hull
- Not permitted for use in B1, but permitted in B2, A etc
- Intended to assess geographic extent of occupation more than purely communicability of risk
- Fewer assumptions on the taxa
- Greater emphasis on expert guidance in applicability

### Application to this project
For this project, we will refer to continuous EoO as cEoO and discrete as dEoO.

cEoO will be calculated by the minimum convex polygon
dEoE will be calculated by [Buffer Union](#buffer-union)

```
G 4.9

*Entire section*

...

EOO is not intended to be an estimate of the amount of occupied or potential habitat, or a general measure of the taxon’s range

vs

Extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are measures of the current distribution, i.e. they should not include areas where the species no longer exists
```

## Buffer union
Buffer union is an alternative method to alpha hull for establishing a discrete extent of occurrence. In low-volume data, the alpha hull model is highly vulnerable to large-scale changes over time due to changes in a very small number of points. Previous experience with the dataset has shown ~40 % change in dEoO through the addition of <= 4 points. In addition, the drawing order-of-connection used can cause significant deviation in results.

The buffer-union method, whilst novel, is firmly rooted in mathematical geometry and utilises a very well tested and mature framework to calculate. The results from testing showed that buffer-union produces extremely stable results between high and low volumes of data, whilst retaining the ability to reflect changes over time.

At a geometric level, the change is simply moving from 'construct the simplest shape possible because that's all that can be easily calculated' to 'construct the most complex shape possible because the computing power to calculate the area of complex shapes is now common'. A triangle has three sides, a circle has an infinite number.

## Continuous Extent of Occurrence & B1
Expert opinion is that the use of a continuous extent of occurrence does not provide taxon-specific meaningful results for the assessment. As such, B1 is removed as an option.

## Buffer range
In the absence of a table comparable distribution distance metrics per taxon, the value of 40 km has been used for the construction of the buffer in the Buffer Union model. The figure of 40 km is based on the general maximum inter-annual distance between records found in the raw data submitted to BWARS. In plainer terms, it was found that a range of 40 km was a good estimation for the expected expansion of a species from one year to the next. This has been used as a metric for the IUCN definition of `sub population`, though caution should be exercised in the light of the low data volume present for many assessed taxa. Any definition of 'sub population' should be supported by expert opinion.

There are taxa where this buffer range specifically does not apply. If the experts deem this factor to be relevant to interpretation, this fact should be stated in the assessment.

## Area of Occupancy and 10 km resolution data
A minority of records, predominantly in the earliest period of the assessment, are only given at 10km resolution. No automated method is able to convert these to 2 km resolution in a meaningful manner and many records do not have a textual location given. After experimentation and consultation, the decision was taken to simply use records with sub 2 km resolution for the assessment. There was no significant difference between the various attempts in infer a 2 km cell from a 10 km cell, so the simplest and most understandable solution was taken.

```
G 4.10

To ensure valid use of the criteria and maintain consistency of Red List assessments across taxa it is essential to scale estimates of AOO using 2 x 2 km grid cells
```

## AoO methodology
The OSGB datum 27700 was used to separate records into a 2 km resolution grid.

## Threat-defined locations
Following the **Guidance**, locations are defined based upon a shared threat. In the event that a threat-defined location is used, the threat must be defined as per [Threat implications](#threat-implications) and stated in the rationale.

## Quantitative analysis
Given that none of the statistical models present a 'X% chance of extinction with in Y years', criterion E is inapplicable to this assessment.

```
G 4.12

A quantitative analysis is defined here as any form of analysis which estimates the extinction probability of a taxon based on known life history, habitat requirements, threats and any specified management options
```

## Time period for assessment
The time period for this assessment has been modified to be 30 years in length. There are three main reasons for this.

### Poor data volume
A number of taxa have very low data volume estimations. By including a larger volume of data it is possible to gain an improved understanding of the changes a taxon has undergone through time. This is especially true for taxa with low-volume, highly sporadic recording.

### Climate-driven variance
Previous work has uncovered what, in preliminary analysis, appears to be a climate-driven cycle with a length of ~20 years and enough magnitude to impact threshold based assessment. In order to adequately isolate as much of this climate cycle as possible from 'true' declines, a longer range than 10 years needs to be examined.

```
G 4.5.6

The downward phase of a fluctuation will not normally count as a reduction (section 4.5) or a continuing decline (section 4.6); therefore, an observed decline or reduction should not be considered a fluctuation unless there is evidence for this.
```

### European Red List
The closest extant Red List to this assessment is the European Red List, which used a 30 year history. In order to maxmimise compatability between these two Red Lists, and in the absence of any solution to other problems, we have opted for a similar historical period. For more details and reasoning from the European Red List project, please see the European Red List of Bees.

## Criterion C

Criterion C relies on estimations of number of mature individuals at absolute values. These values are entirely inapplicable to the assessed taxa. Criterion C is therefore removed from consideration.

```
G 7

Guidelines for Applying Criterion C
```

## Criterion D

Criterion D relies on absolute values of the population of mature individuals. Given that it is not possible to estimate the number of mature individuals, it is not possible to have a count of the number of mature individuals. As such, criterion D is inapplicable.

```
G 8

A taxon qualifies for criterion D if the population of mature individuals (see section 4.3) is smaller than the threshold set for each of the categories of threat.
```

## Use of Data Deficient
An assessment of 'Data Deficient' may be assigned to any model if it is believed that the model does not have enough information to proceed with an acceptable level of confidence. All effort should be made to avoid a final asessment of Data Deficient, though it is noted that for some taxa there is no alternative. Specifically, this assessment is of a measure of *threat* rather than *rarity*. A rare species is not necessarily a threatened one.

### Modification of 'all criteria'
Due to the inapplicability of a number of the core give assessment criteria, the definition of 'all criiteria' has been changed to 'all applicable criteria'

```
G 10.4

If all of the five criteria have not been considered, DD cannot be used (the taxon must be categorized as NE).
```

## Time Horizon
A time horizon of 100 years has been identified for this project. The predominant population drivers of the assessed taxa are habitat resource availability and climate. 100 years was identified specifically as being a sensible limit for climate change-related prediction.

N.B. Due to:
- the lack of taxon-specific knowledge on the specific lifecycle impacts of various climate events
- the lack of exact sub-annual-cycle climate event predictions

the '100 year horizon' is not intended to be regarded as a concrete statistically modelled point in time. The only way that taxon experts consider future predictions to have enough complexity to be deemed relevant/confident enough to be utilised for threat assessment is through the model of expert opinion. As such, the '100 year time horizon' is intended to permit the relevant specialists to consider any probable threat that will arise during this time period.

It is expected that many future predictions will have a quality grade of `suspected`, limiting them to `near threatened` at most.

```
G 12.1.1

Third, the time horizon is set to a maximum of 100 years into the future, because of the uncertainties in predicting population sizes for a long time from the present day (Mace et al. 2008)

...

Thus, for many species, especially short-lived ones, Red List assessments are based on time horizons much shorter than the long periods over which we now expect the world's climate and its effect on species will change. This by itself may not make climate change fundamentally different: other threats, such as habitat loss may also continue for a long time.
```

## Statistical model expert confidence
The statistical models presented here are entirely at the mercy of the data fed to them. There are expected to be scenarios where any model is incapable of returning an answer which makes sense to the evaluator. In such a situation, the model may, in the most appropriate place, be marked as `data deficient`.

```
Meeting with R. Smith 2023-12-14
```

## Complexity of model outputs
The number of [model assessments](./glossary.md#model-assessment) and [review assessments](./glossary.md#review-assessment) is, at time of writing, expected to number well above 20. This many assessments in a single table proved to be far too complex for a human to meaningfully interpret. In order to remedy this, each individual [review stage](./glossary.md#review-stage) is to be split into a separate table, along with the raw data forming another table.

Each table shall have the binomial and binomial [understanding](./glossary.md#nomenclatural-understanding) as the first and second columns respectively.

```
Meeting with R. Smith 2023-12-14
```

## Confidence Threshold and Status
In order to qualify for a status, a statistical model's 95% confidence upper limit for the trend must be entirely below that status' threshold.

## Application of expert knowledge & cross-model analysis
Multiple assessments require far more information than statistics alone can provide. For example, the model-assessment for `raw data B2` requires an assessment of fragmentation, which uses threat-based locations, as well as any known or observed declines. These questions cannot be answered by the raw data and require the utilisation of other models. This multi-model requirement creates a circular argument as individual models rely on one another to answer various aspects of another, leading to a classification problem.

This ruling states that a singular model be elected to be the representative 'name' for the model-assessment, based on the best-available classification of the main aspect of the criteria.

## Expert opinion as an aggregate of all statistical models
Statistical models exist to be interpreted. Following the ruling of the [application of expert knowledge](#application-of-expert-knowledge--cross-model-analysis), expert opinion may be used to fulfil the supplementary criteria of other `model assessments`. However, these models and criteria may lead to unforseen or unanticipated limitations to what data may or may not be included. For this purpose, the model `expert opinion` has been created with access to `A2` and `A3`. These two model assessments are a place for experts to pull in any knowledge or model that they require to make their best judgement call.

## Expert opinion applicability
The denotion of `expert opinion` applies to the internal team and the wider review team. Any member of either stage may use any ruling which mentions `expert opinion`, and all members are considered experts for this review.

## B Number of Locations and DD
`DD` - Data Deficient - has been added to the list of options for B2. Some taxa have such low data that a judgement on the number of locations cannot be safely made. The predominant cause for this is expected to be low sampling effort or difficulty in obtaining samples.
