# Ruling
This document contains each ruling passed, with any supporting evidence.

## Support of Rulings
NE considers the process of the Red List to be defined by the document `Guidelines for using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria v15.1`. Every ruling possible should be supported by reference to this document, or by reference to a specific decision. Any deviation from the Red List documentation must be clearly marked and provide reasoning for this decision.

## Regional Guidance

Since this is a regional assesment, the document `Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List criteria at regional and national levels v4.0` must also be considered. However, this document is many years older than the current **Guidance** document.

```
G 2.1.2
To do this it is important to refer to guidelines prepared by the IUCN SSC Regional Applications Working Group (e.g., Gärdenfors et al. 2001; IUCN 2003, 2012a; Miller et al. 2007).
```

## Taxonomic level of assessment
This assessment will take place at **species** level. This is the level at which the most available data resides. There is insufficient information to go below this taxonomic rank at a uniform manner.
```
G 2.1.1
The criteria may be applied to any taxonomic unit at or below the species level
```

## Use of Nomenclatural Understandings
The assessment will attach a Nomenclatural Understanding to each assessed species in order to anchor them to their particular interpretation at the time of assessment. These understandings are provided by the Bees Wasps & Ants Recording Society (BWARS). A copy of the which can be retreived from the BWARS website or, if modern nomenclature is imperative, upon request to BWARS.

This ruling satisfies the requirement from the **Regional Guidance** documentation to document the taxonomic standard followed.

```
r V.2
The introductory sections should include a list of the taxonomic groups that have been evaluated against the Red List Criteria as well as what taxonomic standards have been followed. Any regionally determined settings, filters, etc. should also be clearly reported.
```

## Newly described & undescribed taxa
No taxon which is not tracked by BWARS's Understandings system will be considered, as the Understandings system is a pre-requisite to the utilisation of data. Should the BWARS Understandings be found to be missing any taxa, that taxa will be added to the BWARS system, whereupon it will become eligible for use.

This must happen in order to satisfy the ruling on [taxonomic standards](./rulings.md#use-of-nomenclatural-understandings)

## Apis mellifera
It is considered impossible to separate any 'naturalised' colonies of *Apis mellifera* from commercially farmed stock. As such, *Apis mellifera* is considered inelligible for inclusion in this assessment.

```
G 2.1.4
Domesticated taxa (in the case where a taxon comprises both domesticated and wild individuals, only the wild population may be assessed and included; feral animals derived from a domesticated source should not be included)
```

## Transfer between categories
There are no previous Red List assessments carried out under comparable guidelines to the **Guidance** documentation. As such, all changes are considered to be *Nongenuine changes* by default. There are also numerous changes as a result of changes to taxonomy and new information. Expert advice is that it would be considered dangerous to the end user to attempt to conflate previous Red Lists with this assessment due to the volume of changes in taxonomy, nomenclature, data volume, sampling methodology, and sampling effort.

```
G 2.2.1

Nongenuine change:

Criteria revision: The change in category is the result of the revision of the IUCN Red List Criteria (e.g., 1994 v. 2001 versions). These largely relate to criteria A2, A3, A4, D2 and the removal of the 'Conservation Dependent' category.

New information: The change in category is the result of better knowledge about the taxon, e.g. owing to new or newly synthesized information about the status of the taxon (e.g., better estimates for population size, range size or rate of decline).

Taxonomy: The new category is different from the previous owing to a taxonomic change adopted during the period since the previous assessment. Such changes include: newly split (e.g., the taxon is newly elevated to species level), newly lumped (the taxon is recognized following lumping of two previously recognized taxa), and no longer valid/recognized (either the taxon is no longer valid e.g. because it is now considered to be a hybrid or variant, form or subspecies of another species, or the previously recognized taxon differs from a currently recognized one as a result of a split or lump).
```

## Documentation of assessment
Each model may be assessed against multiple criteria. These assessments should be documented and retained with the assessment, unmodified, so that a reader might understand the exact decision process. This takes the place of writing out the individual results in a 'rationale' field, which is necessary due to the number of assessments made per taxon.

```
G 2.5
All assessments should be documented. Threatened classifications should state the criteria and subcriteria that are met
...
If more than one criterion or subcriterion is met for the highest threat category, then each should be listed. Criteria meeting lower categories of threat should also be documented in the assessment Rationale
```

```
G 3.2.5

The level of uncertainty associated with a particular taxon’s assessment is not apparent from the listing itself, potentially complicating and de-valuing interpretation of listings. When a plausible range for each quantity is used to evaluate the criteria, a range of categories may be obtained, reflecting the uncertainties in the data. However, only a single category, based on a specific attitude to uncertainty, will be listed along with the relevant criteria on the IUCN Red List. It is important to note that the range of possible categories should also be indicated, along with the assessors’ attitudes to uncertainty, in the documentation accompanying the assessment.
```

## Data quality levels

### Observed
This criterion is ineligible for use in this assessment as it requires exact census data, which is not present for any assessed taxa.

```
G 3.1
- Population size based on a census of all known mature individuals of the taxon. 
- Population reduction derived from a census of all known mature individuals that took place three generations ago, and a current census of all known mature individuals.
- Continuing decline in the area, extent or quality of habitat derived from a survey of all known habitat, or from aerial photography of all known habitat.
- Continuing decline in the number of mature individuals derived from multiple censuses of all known mature individuals.
```


### Estimated
This criterion may only be applied to statistical models. Expert opinion is explicitly excluded from this criterion and placed in `Inferred`.

```
G 3.1
 *See section on 'Estimated'*
 ...
 The main difference between Estimated (or Projected) and Inferred is that Inferred values rely on more assumptions than estimated values
```

### Inferred
This criterion may be used by expert opinion. The closest analogy to the way that most data for the assessment taxa is obtained is from 'catch statistics'.

```
G 3.1
Examples include population reduction (A2d) inferred from a change in catch statistics
...
The main difference between Estimated (or Projected) and Inferred is that Inferred values rely on more assumptions than estimated values. For example, inferring reduction from catch statistics not only requires statistical assumptions (e.g., random sampling) and biological assumptions (about the relationship of the harvested section of the population to the total population), but also assumptions about trends in effort, efficiency, and spatial and temporal distribution of the harvest in relation to the population
```

### Ranking estimated vs inferred models
The low data volume available for the majority of taxa is deemed problematic enough that the rank of `Estimated` has been reduced to be equivalent to `Inferred`. Statistical methods lacking data are not robust enough to be considered superior to expert opinion. Instead, statistical methods and expert opinion should be considered to be supporting or opposing one another on the same confidence level.

```
2023-12-07 Meeting with Richard Smith
```

### Suspected
In such an information-poor environment, a suspicion of decline should not be relied upon for a `Threat Status` assessment. Any assessment based on a suspicion is highly liable to be the result of poor data collection or availability. As such, no assessment may use `Suspected` for the basis of any `Threat Status`, leaving only `Near Threatened` or `Least Concern` as options for results.

## Threat implications
Threat implications will be considered under a two-axis model of *probability* against *impact*. This model involves first of all assessing whether a risk has high, medium, or low probability of occurring within the appropriate time frame. Secondly, the the risk should be assessed as to whether the impact, should the risk materialise, be high, medium, or low.

## Precautionary vs Evidentiary risk attitude
An evidentiary attitude will be used for this assessment, as the lack of data for many taxa would otherwise result in a number of probably spurious assesments.

This was accepted by Richard Smith on 2023-03-17

```
G 3.2.3

Second, assessors need to consider whether they have a precautionary or evidentiary attitude to risk (known as risk tolerance). A precautionary attitude (i.e., low risk tolerance) will classify a taxon as threatened unless it is highly likely that it is not threatened, whereas an evidentiary attitude will classify a taxon as threatened only when there is strong evidence to support a threatened classification
```

## Inter-taxon lifecycle dependency
There is a specific lack of 'completeness' when it comes to inter-taxon relationships for the assessment taxa. As such, the requirement for 'total' reliance in order to use threats to lifecycle-related taxa has been relaxed to the following:

`A taxon may be considered dependent on another if the expert opinion is that the other taxon constitutes the majority of a dependency`

For example, taxon A parasitises taxon X at 80% rate, taxon Y at 10% rate, and taxon Z at 10% rate. If taxon X is assessed to be `Vulnerable`, taxon A may also be assessed as `Vulnerable`, even without the data to demonstrate that assessment, at the discretion of the subject expert.

This assessment should be considered to be `Expert Opinion` at a level of `Inferred`.

```
G 4.1

In the case of taxa obligately dependent on other taxa for all or part of their life cycles, biologically appropriate values for the host taxon should be used
```

## Mature individuals
Data is not given at any supportable level to distinguish between males, non-reproductive females, and reproductive females. As such, all records are considered to be of `mature individuals`. There are also taxa where only one caste is identifiable to species, where upon the desire to avoid a result of `Data Deficient` causes an exception to be made by default. It is considered highly unlikely that this ruling will cause damage to the integrity of the assessment, especially since no direct count information is being utilised.

```
G 4.3

The number of mature individuals is the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction
```

## Generational Length
A value of 1 year has been selected for the generational length of all assessed taxa under the Red List model's options. This value does not impact obligate multi-brood taxa negatively, since the generational length is longer than the 'true' generational length of obligate multi-brooded taxa. The value of 'generational length' will only be used to calculate the length of assessed time.


```
G 4.4

Generation
```

## Exponential Decline
It cannot be assumed that rates of decline are due to constant factors. The identification of ~20 year climate cycle within obtained data specifically precludes the assumption that any declines (or increases) are due to a constant and continuous factor

```
G 4.5.1

Exponential decline can be assumed in cases where the proportional rate of decline of the population is believed to be constant.
```

## Extent of Occurrence (EoO)
The **Guidance** documentation conflates definitions of EoO. One portion is carried over from the previous version of the documentation, whilst another splits EoO into two components:

- Continuous EoO - One polygon with no holes e.g. Minimum Convex Polygon
- Discrete EoO - Multiple polygons, holes permitted e.g. Alpha Hull, Buffer-Union.

For this project, we will refer to continuous EoO as cEoO and discrete as dEoO.

cEoO will be calculated by the minimum convex polygon
dEoE will be calculated by buffer-union

```
G 4.9

*Entire section*
```

## Buffer union
Buffer union is an alternative method to alpha hull for establishing a discrete extent of occurrence. In low-volume data, the alpha hull model is highly vulnerable to large-scale changes over time due to changes in a very small number of points. Previous experience with the dataset has shown ~40 % change in dEoO through the addition of <= 4 points. In addition, the drawing order-of-connection used can cause significant deviation in results.

The buffer-union method, whilst novel, is firmly rooted in mathematical geometry and utilises a very well tested and mature framework to calculate. The results from testing showed that buffer-union produces extremely stable results between high and low volumes of data, whilst retaining the ability to reflect changes over time.

At a geometric level, the change is simply moving from 'construct the simplest shape possible because that's all we can calculate' to 'construct the most complex shape possible because we can now calculate complex formulae quickly enough'. A triangle has three sides, a circle has an infinite number.

## Continuous Extent of Occurrence & B1
Expert opinion is that the use of a continuous extent of occurrence does not provide taxon-specific meaningful results for the assessment.
