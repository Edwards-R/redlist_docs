# Investigation of the Red List dataset
This file documents various investigations into the provenance of the iRecord dataset. There will be a departure from the [BWARS](./bwars.md) and [Red List](./Red%20List.md) styles, as the iRecord data does not form part of these datasets. Instead, this document will examine the overall picture of iRecord data.

## Provenance of iRecord data
iRecord is likely the largest source of aculeate hymenoptera records by volume in Great Britain. It collects data without prejudice, taking the view that it is better to capture data and await quality control than to risk data being lost due to there being no place to submit. Crucially, iRecord captures data from an unknown range of identification capabilities, and thus produces a data of unknown taxonomic *quality*.

## iRecord verification
iRecord attempts to solve the problem of unknown quality by allowing curated volunteers to verify records. This verification uses two different scales. One system is based on a three point design, the other on a five point design.

Verifiers may review records based on *either*
- examination of individual records
- their personal evaluation of the submitter or record's capability

In the case of the latter, it is possible to 'batch verify' a tranche of records as a particular score. As an example, a verifier could mark all records of *Osmia bicornis* from recorder *John Smith* as 'Considered correct'.

The following information is from [iRecord's help page on verification](https://irecord.org.uk/help/records-verified)

### Three point design
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Accepted|The record is accepted as meeting the standard required for inclusion by the recording scheme or project in question|
|Unconfirmed|The record is in the system but has either not been looked at, or a verification decision not yet been reached|
|Not accepted|The record is NOT accepted as meeting the standard required for inclusion|

### Five point design
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Correct|The verifier is able to confirm that the species has been identified correctly, usually on the basis of photo/s within iRecord (or specimen/s outside iRecord)|
|Considered correct|The verifier has not seen photo/s or specimen/s but has a high degree of confidence that the record is likely to be correct, based on difficulty of ID, date, location and recorder skills/experience etc.|
|Plausible|The record is plausible based on species, date and location, but there is not enough supporting evidence for the possibility of misidentification to be ruled out, and the record remains within the "Unconfirmed" category|
|Not reviewed|The record is in the system but has either not been looked at, or a verification decision not yet been reached (all records start off in this category)|
|Unable to verify|The verifier has a high degree of confidence that the record is likely to be incorrect based on difficulty of ID, date, location and recorder skills/experience (and where no photo/s or specimen/s are available); or photos are available but do not show enough detail to confirm the identification; and/or the record is not sufficiently well documented to confirm (e.g. location is vague)|
|Incorrect|The verifier is able to confirm that the species has not been identified correctly, or the record is erroneous in other respects, on the basis of photo/s or specimen/s, or on information from the recorder|

### BWARS five point design
To complicate matters, a number of verifiers have been running a slightly different scoring system to meet BWARS's data intake needs. Crucially, this alternate system has always placed more emphasis on whether or not an individual record has been examined and less emphasis on *what* about the record has been examined.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Correct|This record has been examined and is deemed correct on the basis of the information present|
|Considered correct|This record has not been examined and is deemed correct on the basis of trust in the recorder|

Under the iRecord system a late summer record that mentions 'swarms of bees flying in circles in sandy soil' would likely be scored as `considered correct`, as it does not have an accompanying photograph. Under the 'BWARS' system the record could, at the discretion of the verifier, be scored as `correct` on the basis that this is very clearly a record of *Colletes hederae: iso. Schmidt & Westrich: 1993*, on the basis that the *record*, rather than any *photo*, contains sufficient information to verify the identification.

Other ranks are untouched.
