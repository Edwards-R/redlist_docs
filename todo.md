## Generational Length & Ants

Rulings has a rule that generation length is 1 year - does this cause any problems for ants, given that the length is only used to establish the 10 year time period that we then boost to 30 years?

## Dispersion range & Ants

40km has been used generically throughout the assessment as a metric for 'probable population'. There are some taxa where this assumption is false, the one I know of are ants which return to the home nest post-mating and don't have a wide-ranging dispersal method. How to document this?

- [ ] Data sources examplanation
- [ ] paper ref for [bayesian occupancy model](./model.md#bayesian-occupancy-trend)
- [ ] [This assessment](./process/raw_data.md) requires that expert opinion be used to assess under `B2`. The statistical figure of tetrad AoO is what is assessed, but `B2` cannot be addressed with purely AoO and requires expert opinion as well.

*Does this need a ruling to state that the model is what forms the basis and expert opinion may be added to any model when deemed necessary to answer Red List criteria?*
