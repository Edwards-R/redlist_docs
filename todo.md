## Generational Length & Ants

Rulings has a rule that generation length is 1 year - does this cause any problems for ants, given that the length is only used to establish the 10 year time period that we then boost to 30 years?

## Dispersion range & Ants

40km has been used generically throughout the assessment as a metric for 'probable population'. There are some taxa where this assumption is false, the one I know of are ants which return to the home nest post-mating and don't have a wide-ranging dispersal method. How to document this?

- [ ] Data sources examplanation
- [ ] paper ref for [bayesian occupancy model](./model.md#bayesian-occupancy-trend)
- [ ] [This assessment](./process/raw_data.md) requires that expert opinion be used to assess under `B2`. The statistical figure of tetrad AoO is what is assessed, but `B2` cannot be addressed with purely AoO and requires expert opinion as well.

*Does this need a ruling to state that the model is what forms the basis and expert opinion may be added to any model when deemed necessary to answer Red List criteria?*

**It did and it has been done**

- [ ] Make document that lists every single model assessment method, and add glossary definition for `model assessment method`. It means 'Way that the model assessment was approached' - specifically for the Bayesian occupancy model where expert opinion assessing it is a 'hidden extra'.

*No need, this is covered by the `process` documentation.*

- [ ] Bayesian expert analysis - Check that Richard is happy with what this is doing. It's not a repeat of expert opinion, it's specifically to interpret the graph with human eyes rather than start -> end calculation. Think 'Philanthus 2015 uptick' as a place where there would be a differentiation.

Pick up with the internal review process documentation. Needs a flow chart and some explanation.
