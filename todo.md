## Generational Length & Ants

Rulings has a rule that generation length is 1 year - does this cause any problems for ants, given that the length is only used to establish the 10 year time period that we then boost to 30 years?

## Dispersion range & Ants

40km has been used generically throughout the assessment as a metric for 'probable population'. There are some taxa where this assumption is false, the one I know of are ants which return to the home nest post-mating and don't have a wide-ranging dispersal method. How to document this?
