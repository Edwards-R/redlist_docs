# Understandings
This document is a brief outline of what a nomenclatural 'Understanding' is. The Understandings encountered in this Red List are all *binomial* Understandings, therefore this is what this document will focus on.

***NB:** Understandings do not fix everything automatically. If in doubt, or if precision is critical, please check the current nomenclature lists. Understandings used in this Red List are only correct for Great Britain, Ireland, and the Channel Isles.*

## What does a binomial Understanding look like?
Some selected examples:
- *Myrmica ruginodis: iso. Bolton & Collingwood: 1975*
- *Nomada sheppardana: iso. Amiet et al: 2007*
- *Lasioglossum nitidiusculum: iso. Amiet et al: 2001*
- *Cephalonomia formiciformis: iso. Perkins: 1976*

## Can they be ignored?
An Understanding can be read as a pure binomial, but this will destroy the extra precision. For example, *Bombus lucorum: iso. Murray et al: 2008* may be read as *Bombus lucorum*, but the reader then has to work out what version of *Bombus lucorum* they have in mind before they know that this is accurate to do.

If in doubt, use the Understanding. They have been used for a very specific reason.

# Further information
The following contains more high-level explanation of what an Understanding is, why Understandings are necessary, as well as how one is written.

## Why do we use binomial Understandings?
Because they fill a very important gap in 'standard' taxonomy: if a taxon is split or name's use is altered, it is possible (and common) for the binomial to become unclear.

As a simple example, the taxa covered by this Red List includes the taxon *Andrena scotica*. The understanding of what exactly *A. scotica* is has been the subject of considerable debate, leading to the recent publication of two works. As a result, there are three (one old, two new) possible interpretations for data relating to *Andrena scotica*:

- The oldest recently-used interpretation is linked to the 1916 Perkins key
- The next oldest is related to the 2018 Else & Edwards work
- The newest is related to the 2022 Wood et al paper

If presented with a record of '*Andrena scotica*', the first question must be 'Which interpretation of *Andrena scotica* are you refering to?'

Understandings solve this problem without requiring the use of complex systems such as the UKSI's TK/TVK/TLIK combinations.

## Reading an Understanding
An Understanding is composed of four parts. These are:
- The nomenclature
- The 'identifier'
- The author of the Understanding
- The year of Understanding creation

The information above is combined into a name, where the 'identifier' exists to let the user know what they are reading is an Understanding in a given format.

The format used in this Red List is simply known as the 'iso' (eye-so) format. This is simply an abbreviation of 'In the Sense Of'.

The iso format uses `:` (colon) to separate components where needed. The purpose of this is to enable precise machine reading without the need to resort to purely numerical identifiers such as in the UKSI.

## Example using *Nomada sheppardana*
The iso-format Understanding for *Nomada sheppardana*, at the time of writing this document, is:

*Nomada sheppardana: iso. Amiet et al: 2007*

|Component|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Nomada sheppardana|The nomenclature|
|:|Separator to denote end of nomenclature|
|iso.|Identifies the Understanding as being in `iso` format|
|Amiet et al| The author of the Understanding|
|:|Separator to denote end of author(s)|
|2007|The year that the change in Understanding was accepted|

This means that the Understanding of *Nomada sheppardana* used in the Red List adheres to that identified by Amiet et al in 2007.
