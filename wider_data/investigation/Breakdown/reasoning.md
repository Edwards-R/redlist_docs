# Breakdown of Data
This document covers the reasoning behind the breakdown of both the iRecord and BWARS datasets. Please note that the data under consideration here is *not* the Red List dataset, but the BWARS dataset. The difference is due to the Red List dataset having been made over a year ago.

### Removal of binomial confusion
In order to maintain parity, the assessment of the BWARS data will, unless otherwise stated, be restricted to only the taxa present in the iRecord dataset.

## Overall data volume
This section covers the overall size of each dataset under different conditions. The examinations are:
- Count of all records
- Count of all species-resolution records 
- Count of records per year, from 1992 to 2021 (inclusive)

## Nomenclatural confusion
Nomenclatural confusion, especially where a name is split (e.g. `A` -> `A` & `B`) has the potential to greatly interfere with occurrence datasets. The 2024 BRC recorders day highlighted this, with a number of talks referencing the problems encountered by such an event. BWARS has mitigated the worst effects of such changes by using a system which cleanly differentiates between pre- and post- alteration uses of a given binomial. The examination of a system using this novel approach against one which does not provides an opportunity to examine the magnitude of impact.

As the BWARS Understanding system has not existed for only five years, it is not yet possible to know exactly how many changes have occured in the time of interest (1992-2021). A significant portion of 'changes' in this time period reflect a need to 'stablise' nomenclature around a given key rather than a 'true' change.

As such, the magnitude of impact will be extracted by discarding any record from a taxon where there are multiple (i.e. >1) potential interpretations of a given binomial. The final result will be the number of records prior to this step compared to the number of records after this step.

## Breakdown per broad taxonomic group
[As alluded to](../why%20investigate.md), the taxa covered by this Red List project have very diverse 'recording environments'. Interest in 'pollination', both from the public and scientific communities, has caused a spike in interest in bees. BWARS in response has promoted recording taxa other than bees to its members, providing several talks and workshops at the BWARS AGM covering wasps and ants. Data on wasps has responded very favourably, whilst ant data lags behind in volume-per-taxon.

Other recording groups that BWARS has spoken to, especially those with more complex identification issues for their taxa, have not identified anything like the size of issues BWARS has experienced when attempting to use iRecord data. One explanation for this is that the increased public interest in the group, which does take considerable skill to identify to species, has caused a disproportionate skew in the number of problems. To investigate this idea, as well as provide data on general recording trends, broad taxonomic groups have been identified. These groupings have been ranked by experienced taxonomists in an order which *very roughly* approximates a mixture between ease of identification, and the general 'skill progression' which a new recorder goes through. Do note that this is *very* general, and not every recorder goes through this progression. Comparisons from one grouping to the next are certainly not as stark as from start to finish.

The groups identified are:

- Bombus
- Non-Bombus bee
- Eusocial wasp
- Solitary wasp
- Ant
