## Notes from Wider Review
Largest problem was the maps. Reviewers were seeing 'old' cells and assuming that these were re-visited and the taxon not found. Reviewers also assumed that 'new' cells (slice 2 & 3) were visited in the previous slices and the taxon found there. This is *not* the case for the vast majority of taxa, especially the rarer ones. The ability to toggle layers on and off in QGIS allows us to see that, but the reviewers only had a rasterised map to use. These details *can* be inferred from the 'Buffer Union % All' figure, but that is a novel utilisation of the method and not common knowledge.
