# Dolichovespula sylvestris: iso. Archer: 1989
## Provisional status: NT
- A2 b,c

## Justification
Data in the second time slice (2017-2021) is heavily biased by the addition of a number of records from north-east Scotland. These records are the result of a singular entomologist going on holiday.

In the same period, the area south of the Severn-Wash line has experienced a major loss in both number of records and number of tetrads. Given that this southern area has the greatest number and frequency of surveys, the absence is likely to be true.

|**Action**|Maintained|
|**Reviewed Status**|NT|
|**Justification**|Further analysis of the data, including that from iRecord, shows a very distinct lack of records from south of the Wash-Severn line. This variation is far past the point where it could be considered a year-on-year fluctuation.|
